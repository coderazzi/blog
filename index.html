	    <p>This page is devoted to my interest areas. Namely, CORBA and Java. C++ is another of my main topics, but somehow it seems
		to occupe my job's time and therefore none on my "hobby's" projects have been done using this great language.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Although I'm planing to include a links page, I'm not really confident about it: these previous pages shown the same
		objective and for more than 4 years they staid untouched... without any links page. It is said that failing to plan is 
		planning to fail, I'm wondering if the opposite also remains true!</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Most of the following applications are really old, but I keep on using them. Probably the least useful nowadays is an
		applet I did to put some <i>charme</i> to my old webpages. Applets are now synonim of slow pages, while the java virtual
		machine starts, or synonim of useless applications, as the <i>only one</i> browser does not want to make friends with
		Java anymore.

		<p>IDLdepend is an ANT CORBA task. It is is useful for any <i>ant</i> user needing to support OMG/IDL specifications. 
		Its purpose is to keep the dependencies between java classes and IDL specifications, avoiding rebuilding them when possible.</p>
		<p>It supports currently five CORBA compilers: JDK (1.4), Orbacus, OpenORB, Orbix and Jacorb. Each compiler has a different set of
		arguments, and not all of them is supported, but most and for the sure the main ones are included.</p>  
		<p>It's free, and the source is also available. As I would like to provide an stable application, full support is included,
		the same to solve any bug as to extend any required functionality.</p>

		<p>This application is the base for my doctoral degree. It features a complete fault tolerant environment, supporting

		<h2><font color="#333399">Virtual Net</font></h2>
		<p>VirtualNet is an application I wrote some time ago to deal with an specific problem associated to distributed applications:
		application's behaviour in case of faulty or slow network links.</p>
		<p>Its purpose id to provide to the user, who is working on an standalone machine, with the abstraction of a virtual network.
		Hosts can be created or removed, as well as the links between them. A nice graphical interface allows to track down the network
		behaviour, breaking links or modifying their associated delays. In this way, an application built on top of the virtual network
		will experiment the problems that can happen on a <i>real</i> network.</p>
		<p>The paradigm is not complete, as the network behaviour does not follow any real network protocol, but the results are quite
		similar: at the end, if a link is missbehaving, any protocol using it will have some kind of problems.To make interesting this 
		idea, the system must be as transparent as possible. It is not very effective to have to rewrite an existing application to use 
		this virtual network to check for problems. The objective is to be able to test the original application without changes.</p>
		<p>This is the first versiion of <i>VirtualNet</i>, which was published in <i><a href="http://www.jars.com">Jars</a></i> and 
		received a really good rate on 1997 (perhaps it was much easier to receive good qualifications when not that many people would 
		master Java??). This version is only workable under Java/RMI, that is, the distributed system had to use Java/RMI as transport 
		layer / communication protocol.	What is more, it relied on replacing the RMI registry, which makes it unsuitable for any RMI 
		application whose communications can be done without using the registry.</p>

		<h2><font color="#333399">Virtual Net 2</font></h2>
		<p>The second version of Virtual Net follows the same principles and shares some code, but is completely focused on CORBA. 
		It uses <i>interceptors</i> to make all the communications completely transparent. An application needs only to specify on the 
		command line some information, like the virtual host where it will run, and to include an additional line on its source, to handle 
		the extra arguments on the command line. From that moment on, any communication is intercepted to verify its virtual path; if a 
		path is not available at any single moment, the application receives a communication exception, exactly as it would happend in 
		the real case in case of a network fault.</p>

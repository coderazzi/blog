		<h1>DJMovies - Django Movies</h1>

		<p>
			<b>DJMovies</b> is a django application that I started writing on April 1st 2013, to handle my
			private catalog of movies. In addition to catalog the movies, it exposes through its web interface
			multiple tools to handle them: homogenize video and audio formats, subtitles handling, etc.
		</p>
		<img alt='screenshot' src='djmovies.png' class="centered">
		<p>
			<b>DJMovies</b> accesses external services, like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>
			to retrieve movie information, or <a href="https://www.moviesubtitles.org/">Moviesubtitles.org</a> to
			download subtitles.
		</p>
		<p>
			Precisely this dependency on external services makes the project eternally unfinished. The access
			to the services scraps the information, but those services keep updating the appearance of their
			pages, requiring a regular update to the scraping process. Most of the changes implemented since
			2014 relate exclusively to these updates.
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of my process to stop using private repositories in my own VPSs, I am now including these
			repositories in Github.

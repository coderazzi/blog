<h1>alter table - Python command to alter sqlite3 tables</h1>


<p><span class='mark'>alter_table</span> is a python utility to alter sqlite3 tables. It allows for several
	operations not directly supported in sqlite:</p>

<ul><li>Drop columns</li>
	<li>Rename columns</li></ul>

<p>All operations are performed from the command line. The supported arguments are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>First argument: the filename with the sqlite3 database.</li>
	<li>Next arguments: operations to perform, which can be one of:
		<ul>
			<li><span class='mark'>table:-column</span> drops the specified column in the given table.</li>
			<li><span class='mark'>table:column=new_name</span> renames the specified column in the given table with the new provided name</li>
		</ul>
		An argument can provide several operations at once, like in: <span class='mark'>table:column=new_name:-column</span>
	</li>
</ul>	

<p>The utility generates a new database, on a file on the same path with the same name as the original, but prepending <span class='mark'>altered-</span></p>

<h2><a name='restrictions'>Restrictions</a></h2>

<p>When a column in a table is dropped renamed, the related indexes are automatically recreated (or removed), reflecting the new names
	given to the columns.</p>

<p>There could be additional side effects on altering tables: triggers and views require additional updates, but <span class='mark'>alter_table</span> does not perform these. So the user must ensure proper recreation of triggers and views if required (indexes are properly updated)</p>

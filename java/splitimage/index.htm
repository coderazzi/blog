 <h1>SplitImage class</h1>

 <p>This class allows to do a very simple task: to split an image
 in different images, all of them with the same size, which can be
 used for lot of purposes. I needed it, for example, to develop the
 <a href="../menu/index.htm">Menu</a> applet.</p>

 <p>Its implementation is based on the CropImageFilter class, whose
 purpose is to filter only a portion of an image. Using this class,
 the implementation becomes really very simple.</p>

 <p>To use the class, it is needed to create an <em>SplitImage</em>
 object, passing the image to split, and the number of rows and
 columns in which the image will be splitted.</p>

 <p>After this, it is possible to get an <em>Image Producer</em>
 for any valid row and column, using the <em>getImageProducer</em>
 method. It is also possible to obtain the height and the width of
 the splitted images using the <em>getHeight</em> and
 <em>getWidth</em> methods. That's all!</p>

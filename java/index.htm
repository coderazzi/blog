 <p>Most of the following applications are plain old. Probably the
 least useful nowadays is an applet I did to put some charme to my
 old webpages. Applets are now synonim of slow pages, while the
 java virtual machine starts, or synonim of useless applications,
 as many users directly disable the Java engine. Anyway, here is
 the original code, together with some other utilities.</p>
 <div class='hr'>&nbsp;</div>

 <h2>CmdLinker</h2>

 <p>This application, that I created in June 2007, is a tool to execute 
 multiple commands in one window, each on its own tabbed window.

 <h2>FileSplit</h2>

 <p>This application is a file utility. It splits files into
 smaller chunks, making it useful to squeeze them into specific
 formats, usually floppy disks.</p><a href="filesplit/index.htm">Go
 to FileSplit page</a>
 <div class='hr'>&nbsp;</div>

 <h2>IDL depend</h2>

 <p><span class='mark'>IDLdepend</span> is an ANT CORBA task. It is
 is useful for any <em>ant</em> user needing to support OMG/IDL
 specifications. Its purpose is to keep the dependencies between
 java classes and IDL specifications, avoiding rebuilding them when
 possible.</p>

 <p>It supports several CORBA compilers. Each compiler has a
 different set of arguments, and not all of them is supported, but
 most and for the sure the main ones are included.</p>

 <p>It's free, and the source is also available. As I would like to
 provide an stable application, full support is included, the same
 to solve any bug as to extend any required
 functionality.</p><a href="idldepend/index.htm">Go to IDLdepend
 page</a>
 <div class='hr'>&nbsp;</div>

 <h2>Menu Applet</h2>

 <p>An applet quite simple, showing a graphical menu that changes
 as the mouse passes over the different options.</p>

 <p>Note that this page shows the applet in action, and therefore
 it will load your Java Virtual Machine</p><a href=

 <h2>Sensei</h2>

 <p>This application is the base for my doctoral degree. It
 features a complete fault tolerant environment, supporting
 distributed applications using JavaRMI or CORBA. These libraries
 make much easier the development of fault tolerant applications,
 supporting concepts like distributed monitors and distributed
 transactions.</p>

 <p>This project is hosted on my pages at <a href=
 "http://grasia.fdi.ucm.es/sensei">university.</a></p>
 <div class='hr'>&nbsp;</div>

 <h2>Split Image</h2>

 <p><span class='mark'>SplitImage</span> is just a class, used in
 the <a href="#MenuApplet">Menu Applet</a> to split any
 <em>gif</em> or <em>jpg</em> file into smaller pieces.</p><a href=
 "splitimage/index.htm">Go to SplitImage page</a>
 <div class='hr'>&nbsp;</div>

 <h2>Table Filter</h2>

 
 <p><a href='tablefilter/index.html'>TableFilter</a> provides 
 advanced Swing components to enable user filtering on tables. 
 Its main component is a header, that located atop a JTable 
 enables the input of complex filtering expressions on one or 
 more columns.</p>
 <div class='hr'>&nbsp;</div>

 <h2>Virtual Net</h2>

 <p><span class='mark'>VirtualNet</span> is an application I wrote
 some time ago to deal with an specific problem associated to
 distributed applications: application's behaviour in case of
 faulty or slow network links.</p>

 <p>Its purpose id to provide to the user, who is working on an
 standalone machine, with the abstraction of a virtual network.
 Hosts can be created or removed, as well as the links between
 them. A nice graphical interface allows to track down the network
 behaviour, breaking links or modifying their associated delays. In
 this way, an application built on top of the virtual network will
 experiment the problems that can happen on a <em>real</em>
 network.</p>

 <p>The paradigm is not complete, as the network behaviour does not
 follow any real network protocol, but the results are quite
 similar: at the end, if a link is missbehaving, any protocol using
 it will have some kind of problems.To make interesting this idea,
 the system must be as transparent as possible. It is not very
 effective to have to rewrite an existing application to use this
 virtual network to check for problems. The objective is to be able
 to test the original application without changes.</p>

 <p>This is the first version of <span class=
 'mark'>VirtualNet</span>, which was published in <a href=
 "http://www.jars.com">Jars</a> and received a really good rate on
 1997 (perhaps it was much easier to receive good qualifications
 when not that many people would master Java??). This version is
 only workable under Java/RMI, that is, the distributed system had
 to use Java/RMI as transport layer / communication protocol. What
 is more, it relied on replacing the RMI registry, which makes it
 unsuitable for any RMI application whose communications can be
 done without using the registry.</p><a href=

 <h2>Virtual Net 2</h2>

 <p>The second version of <span class='mark'>Virtual Net</span>
 follows the same principles and shares some code, but is
 completely focused on CORBA. It uses <em>interceptors</em> to make
 all the communications completely transparent. An application
 needs only to specify on the command line some information, like
 the virtual host where it will run, and to include an additional
 line on its source, to handle the extra arguments on the command
 line. From that moment on, any communication is intercepted to
 verify its virtual path; if a path is not available at any single
 moment, the application receives a communication exception,
 exactly as it would happend in the real case in case of a network
 fault.</p><a href="virtualnet2/index.htm">Go to VirtualNet2

 <h2>XMLObjects</h2>

 <p><a href='csharp/xmlobjects/index.html'>XMLObjects</a> is a lightweight library 
 to map Xml documents to C# classes, whose main purpose is to simplify 
 the handling of simple Xml files

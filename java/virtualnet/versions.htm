 <h1>VirtualNet (over RMI)</h1>
 <h2>Version changes</h2>
 <div class='hr'>&nbsp;</div>

 <ul type="square">
  <li><a href="#v021">version 0.1 to 0.21</a></li>
 </ul>

 <div class='hr'>&nbsp;</div>
 <h3><a name="v021" id="v021">version 0.21</a></h3>

 <p>The version 0.1 was limited in the number of nodes. This
 version eliminates that limit. To do that:</p>

 <ul type="square">
  <li>A Node is not defined by a character, but by an string. This
  string can have any character from 'A' to 'P'.</li>

  <li>A Link was previously defined by a <em>short</em>. This was
  really a bad design; now it is used an <em>integer</em>.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The impact has been quite small. There is now an
 incompatibility with the previous version; in v0.1, when a link is
 going to be builded using the BuildNetLayout, it has to have the
 format <em>NodeANodeBLink</em>; now, it is
 <em>NodeALinkNodeB</em>, like +AB12C.</p>

 <p>The display package does have a big impact, to be able to deal
 with any number of nodes. There are below some snaphots of the new
 display graphs:</p>

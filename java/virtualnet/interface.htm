 <h1>VirtualNet (over RMI)</h1>
 <h2>Interface</h2>
 <div class='hr'>&nbsp;</div>

 <p>Despite the fact that there are two versions of VirtualNet, the
 local and the remote, there is a shared interface, defined by the
 classe <em>vnet.NetLayout</em>. This interface allows mainly
 to:</p>

 <ul type="square">
  <li>Add a new node to the net.</li>

  <li>Remove an existing node.</li>

  <li>Insert a new link between two nodes.</li>

  <li>Remove any existing link.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>In the operations on this NetLayout, it is also possible to
 define a delay general and also particular delays for each node
 and each link; this delay would be the equivalent to the inherent
 delay on any net.</p>

 <p>The class <em>vnet.BuildNetLayout</em> allows the construction
 of a net from a string. This string indicates the nodes and links
 to be created (or to be destroyed).</p>

 <p>The server operations: [<em>bind, rebind, unbind, lookup</em>]
 are defined in the local and remote version of
 <em>VirtualNet</em>. The remote version tries to be transparent
 with respect to the <em>java.rmi.Naming</em> interface and it
 defines the same functionality, even it is defined the method
 <em>list</em>, with the same exceptions. These operations are:</p>

 <ul type="square">
  <li>Bind a server to a node, with an specific name. The remote
  version allows, as RMI does, to bind a server in a different
  machine, that is, in a different node.</li>

  <li>Rebind a server to a node, with a specific name, even if the
  name is already in use.</li>

  <li>Unbind a server</li>

  <li>Lookup a server, that is look for a node in the net. It is
  possible to specify the node on which the server is binded.</li>

  <li>For the remote version, it is possible to get a list of the
  servers binded to the virtual net.</li>
 </ul>For the remote version, this interface is given by
 <em>vnet.remote.HostImpl</em>, a RMI server. The class
 <em>vnet.remote.VirtualNet</em> is not a remote server; to make it
 possible to modify the net layout, there is a class,
 <em>vnet.remote.VirtualNetRemote</em> that allows to do the
 NetLayout operations using RMI.

        <h1>CentOS - Hostname via DHCP</h1>

        <p>
            I created a CentOS Virtual Machine using static IP addressing.
            Afterwards, I changed the networking to use instead DHCP, so that the name would be properly obtained from the DHCP server.
            Eventually, I performed a set of operations, including adding a second NIC and disabling the Network Manager.
            And, along the way, the hostname reverted to the initial static hostname that I had initially allocated.
        </p>
        <p>
            I looked for the usual suspects, including <b>/etc/hosts</b> and <b>/etc/hostname</b>, but nothing seemed wrong.
            I checked the file <b>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions</b>, that contains a function called <b>need_hostname</b>
        </p>
<pre>
need_hostname ()
{
    CHECK_HOSTNAME=$(hostname)
    if [ "$CHECK_HOSTNAME" = "(none)" -o "$CHECK_HOSTNAME" = "localhost" -o \
        "$CHECK_HOSTNAME" = "localhost.localdomain" ]; then
        return 0
    else
        return 1
    fi
}</pre>

        <p>
            And the problem was that, on the first line, CHECK_HOSTNAME was initialized with the initial static hostname (centos7).
        </p>

        <p>
            The command <b>hostamectl</b> gave some additional information:
        </p>

<pre>
   Static hostname: n/a
Transient hostname: centos7
         Icon name: computer
           Chassis: n/a
        Machine ID: 5c9e46abd14b479ab95c2488fc96de55
           Boot ID: 297819ceb8f848ceb2379c9dc629d214
    Virtualization: kvm
  Operating System: CentOS Linux 7 (Core)
       CPE OS Name: cpe:/o:centos:centos:7
            Kernel: Linux 3.10.0-229.20.1.el7.x86_64
      Architecture: x86_64
</pre>
        <p>
            Now, looking to the function <b>need_hostname</b> above,
            I realized that any name except (none) or localhost ot localhost.domain would imply that no hostname was required.
            Ok, time to change the transient hostname:
        </p>
<pre>hostnamectl set-hostname '' --transient</pre>

        <p>
            But this does nothing: that is the transient name, each time the machine is rebooted, is lost.
            What is needed is to set the static hostname, so the following line should solve this issue:
        </p>
<pre>
    hostnamectl set-hostname localhost --static
</pre>

<h2><a name='Description'>Description</a></h2>
<p><span class='mark'>XmlObjectsDocGui</span> is a tool that complements 
<a href='http://www.coderazzi.net/csharp/xmlobjects'>xmlobjects</a>, supporting the automatic
generation of Html documentation from the information in the Xml schema used in 
<span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span>.</p>

<p>It extracts the comments embedded in the C# definition of the Xml schema, and uses the 
Xml hierarchy definition to generate the final Html pages.
Currently, it only supports Gui handling, and the user cannot choose among different schemas.
Specially interesting, on a future version, would be the generation of the full documentation in
a single document.</p>

<p>The idea behind <span class='mark'>XmlObjectsDocGui</span> is to use the normal C# documentation
accompanying the C# definition of the Xml Schema, to provide comprehensive documentation for
that schema. <span class='mark'>Microsoft</span> has defined the 
<a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b2s063f7(VS.80).aspx'>format of those comments</a>,
but the only way to extracting them is by using the C# compiler. This tool requires, therefore:
<ul>
<li>
The C# compiler, which will be invoked with the /doc argument.
</li>
<li>
The list of C# files defining the Xml schema.
</li>
<li>
Any DLL file referenced by those C# files.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
It is needed also the target directory to store the generated documentation; this documentation
is, as Xml, hierarchical, and needs the root type. It is possible to define this root type in
the main application form, or require the application to show the list of types from where to 
select that type.

<h2><a name='LicenseAndDownload'>License and download</a></h2>
<p><span class='mark'>XmlObjectsDocGui</span> is delivered as it, without
any responsabilities on the author. It is open source, it can be used or
modified without any limitations.</p>

<p>This application is only available in source format. 
<ul>
	<li>Version 1.00. (05/05/08).
	<ul><li><a href="xmlobjectsdocgui-1-0.zip">xmlobjectsdocgui-1-0.zip</a></li></ul>

</ul>

<h2><a name='xmlobjects'>Dependency on XmlObjects</a></h2>

<p><span class='mark'>XmlObjectsDocGui</span> is designed to be independent of the <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span>
library. Better explained, it is designed to be independent of the library version.</p>

<p>The motivation is that the generation of the documentation of the schema depends on how <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span>
interpretates that schema; it is therefore possible that the same C# structures defines different Xml schemas depending
on the version of the library that is used. <span class='mark'>XmlObjectsDocGui</span> allows therefore to provide 
the exact library associated to an schema. This requirements has complicated the implementation of this application,
but is also a good exercise on dynamic load of libraries.</p>

<p>In any case, <span class='mark'>XmlObjectsDocGui</span> still requires <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span>: 
to facilitate the usage of the application, it stores information on the last run as 
a configuration file. This is a Xml configuration file, and it is, obviously, loaded and stored using the 
<span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span> library.</p>

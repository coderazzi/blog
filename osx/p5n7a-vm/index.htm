<h1>OsX Leopard on Asus P5N7A-VM (vanilla)</h1>

<p>At insanelymac there is a 
<a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=148416&st=200&p=1080065&#entry1080065'>discussion</a>
 on how to install Leopard on the P5N7A-VM using the boot-132 method.</p>
 
<p>I had built my PC without a CD-ROM (this is intended to be my server), and, as you could read on the
previous discussion, the USB ports are all but useless, so I was out of luck to install Leopard on the usual boot-132 terms.</p>

<p>However, I had two running Leopard machines, a Mac mini and a <a href='../p5q-e/index.htm'>hackintosh</a>, so I decided to install Leopard on a separate hard disk, and set it up completely for the P5N7A-VM motherboard, where I would move later the disk. It worked beautifully, and the single feature not right is the shutdown/restart functionality. I can live without that. The USB works now perfectly (at 480 Mbs), and Os X updates are installed without a glitch.</p>

<p>The only problem I have found is rebooting into Os X after working in Ubuntu. In this case, the network driver does not work; the solution is to shutdown the Ubuntu server completely (power off the computer, not just software shudown) before starting Os X. Again, something I can handle.</p>

<p>This is my hardware:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Cpu: E5200.</li>
	<li>Motherboard: Asus P5N7A-VM (with Nvidia 9300 GPU)</li>
	<li>Memory: 4Gb (2 Corsair PC2-800).</li>
	<li>Hard disk: Hitachi 500 Gb</li>
	<li>A hotswap rack</li>
	<li>PSU: Be Quiet 300 W</li>	
	<li>Case: LianLi PCV-350B, with 2 120mm and 1 80 mm fan, regulated by the motherboard, plus another
	90 mm fan on mini Ninja Cpu cooler. I have also a Thermalright HR-05 cooler for the GPU, without fans.
	The case is almost silent, the PSU is the noisest component, and it is pretty silent.</li>
</ul>

<p>The installation required 9 steps. Obviously, most of these steps apply to any motherboard, as far as
the right drivers are available. I include first a detailed description of the steps I executed for the P5N7A-VM motherboard, and then a <a href='#summary'>generic description</a> for any motherboard.</p>

<p><span class='mark'>Attention: update via software update to 10.5.8 does not work: Ethernet is lost, but easily recovered,
and sound is gone, without solution so far. I will try next VoodooHDA, as I did with my 
<a href='../p5q-e/index.htm#1058'>P5Q-E hackintosh</a>.</span></p>

<h2>Steps for P5N7A-VM</h2>

<ol>
 <li>The first step is to install Leopard on a free partition (20 Gb). I used retail 10.5.6. This installation can be done:
 <ul>
   <li>Using a Mac, directly, just specifying the free partition.</li>
   <li>Using the hackintosh, I had to install the retail DVD in yet another free partition (9 Gb), and then boot it using then boot-132 method. As usual, it ends with error.</li>
 </ul>
 The chosen free partition must be in a disk partitioned with MBR or with GUID. In the first case, the given partition must be one of the first 3 partitions, must be primary, and there must be not logical partitions before. 
 </li>
 <li>Now, it is needed to setup the installed partition. For that, reboot first on the working Mac / hackintosh</li>
 <li>Copy the <a href='DSDT.aml'>DSDT.aml</a> for the associated CPU. 
 This file was provided by <span class='mark'>Diabolik</span>, and is available 
   <a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=148416&st=200&p=1082035&#entry1082035'>here</a>; have a look at this forum in case that newer versions are published. 
   In the same place is available the <a href='DSDT.dsl'>DSDT.dsl</a> required for quad cores. Note that this file must be copied on the root directory in the installed partition.</li>
 <li>Install <a href='http://chameleon.osx86.hu/'>Chameleon</a> on the installed partition, including the Extra files, although most of them are not needed.</li>
 <li>The previous step created an <span class='mark'>Extra</span> folder in the root directory in the installed partition. It contains a file <a href='com.apple.Boot.plist'>com.apple.Boot.plist</a> where I added a timeout of 1 second to boot into Os X, specifying:
 <pre>&lt;key&gt;Timeout&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt;</pre></li>
 <li>In the same directory, I included my own <a href='smbios.plist'>smbios.plist</a>, although this is only needed to have nice values displayed on the <span class='mark'>About this mac</span> dialog.</li>
 <li>Under this directory, enter the folder <span class='mark'>Extensions</span>. It should only contain the following kexts:
 <ul>
    <li><span class='mark'>AppleDecrypt.kext</span>: directly included by Chameleon</li>
    <li><span class='mark'>IOAHCIBlockStorageInjector.kext</span>: directly included by Chameleon</li>
    <li><span class='mark'>OpenHalRestart.kext</span>: directly included by Chameleon</li>
    <li><span class='mark'>AppleHDA.kext</span>: provided in the
    <a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?act=attach&type=post&id=45081'>insanelymac</a> forum,
    by <span class='mark'>frodokenny</span>, required for the audio to work. This driver comes with the next one:</li>
    <li><span class='mark'>HDAEnabler.kext</span></li>
 </ul>
 I copied also the file <span class='mark'>AppleHDA.kext</span> into the <span class='mark'>/System/Library/Extensions</span> folder in the installed partition.
 </li>
 <li>Now, it is needed to set the correct access rights for each file. So, eject the installed partition, open a terminal window and mount again the partition (preserving rights) on the terminal doing something like:
 <pre>sudo mount -t hfs /dev/disk1s2 tmpdir</pre>
 where tmpdir is any temporal directory, and disk1s2 must be correctly specified (look at the Disk Utility program for the identity assigned to the installed partition).
 <pre> cd tmpdir
 sudo chown root:wheel DSDT.aml
 sudo chown -R root:wheel Extra</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Finally, rebuild the <span class='mark'>Extensions.mkext</span> files found in 
 the <span class='mark'>/Extra</span> and <span class='mark'>/System/Library</span> folders. To do so,
 I have created the file <a href='updateMkext.sh'>updateMkext.sh</a> in the <span class='mark'>/Extra</span>
 folder, with the following code:
 <pre>KEXT_RETAIL="../System/Library/Extensions"
KEXT_EXTRA="../Extra/Extensions"
MKEXT="../Extra/Extensions.mkext"

kextcache -v 1 -t -l -a i386 -m "$MKEXT" "$KEXT_EXTRA" "$KEXT_RETAIL"</pre>

 <a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t159063.html'>insanelymac</a>.
 To execute it:
 <pre>cd /Extra
sudo ./updateMkExt.sh</pre>
</ol>

<p>Now, the hard disk with the newly Leopard installed can be swapped to the final machine, with the P5N7A-VM motherboard. Of course, to start it, it is needed a boot partition manager, and I used Grub, already installed in a separate hard disk.</p>

<p>That is all. I still copied the installed partition into the hard disk normally used in my machine, to avoid having two hard disks installed, but this step is obviously not required.</p>

<h2><a name='summary'>Summary for any motherboard</a></h2>

<p>I am sure this summary works for any motherboard, if you are able to get the right drivers (kexts), which
is obviously the difficult part. In addition, it requires a working Mac or hackintosh:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install from a Mac/Hackintosh Leopard (I used 10.5.6) on a separate partition on the final hard disk.</li>
<li>Reboot into the working Mac/Hackintosh, mounting the final hard disk as well.</li>
<li>Unless the BIOS is patched (or is directly supported), copy DSDT.aml or DSDT.dsl to the root of the installed partition.</li>
<li>Install Chameleon on this partition.</li>
<li>Prepare convenienly the Extra folder. This is a trial and error loop, until all required kexts -and none more- are there. It must be also ensured that the access rights to all the files in this folder are correct (owner: root, group: wheel).</li>
<li>Swap the hard disk to the final machine, and ensure you can boot it (Grub is my best choice)</li>
</ol>

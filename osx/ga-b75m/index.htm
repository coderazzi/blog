<h1>Mavericks on Gigabyte GA-B75M</h1>

	<p>
		I created my first Hackintosh in 2009, and the process required some thinking. There were already quite a few guides, and, of course, some people had done already the dirty work of working out the drivers and the mechanisms to make Os X install on alien, non Apple, hardware, but the process was definitely not simple. I did then in quick succession 3 hackintoshes, using the same approach.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fast forward to 2012, I built a new computer and hackintoshed it again, this time with Mountain Lion. In the passed 3 years, the hackintoshing landscape had changed very much, and the process to install OsX was as easy as using the tools Unibeast and Mutibeast provided by <a href='http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php'>tonymacx86</a>. The more serious thinking at this stage was the pre-purchase steps, to ensure that the hardware was as Apple-compatible as possible. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Today I decided to upgrade my existing Mountain Lion installation to Mavericks, or, better said, to scrap the Mountain Lion system to have a clean Mavericks one. Again, the process was very simple, and the only difficulty was getting hold of the Mavericks installation application: there are again many ways to achieve this, but I went the easy path, downloading it using a Macbook Pro.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is the specification of my system: <img class='right' src='case.png'/> 
		<ul>
			<li>Motherboard: <b>Gigabyte GA-B75M-D3P</b>. With <b>Intel HD4000</b> graphics.</li>
			<li>CPU: <b>i7 4770K</b></li>
			<li>Memory: <b>32 Gb</b></li>
			<li>Hard Disk: <b>Samsung 840 EVO 240 Gb</b></li>
			<li>Extras: IO bracket with USB 3.0 support</li>
			<li>Case: LianLi PCV-351</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		The BIOS settings are basically the default ones. In special, VT is enabled, but <b>VT-D must be disabled</b>. Also, XHCI and EHCI handoff must be enabled.
	</p>

	<p>
		Using UniBeast 4.0.3, Mavericks installation was flawless. Before executing Multibeast, I installed all the upgrades, reboot the machine, and checked what was missing: only audio was not working, time to start Multibeast 6.5.0.
	</p>

	<p>
		The only issue I found with Multibeast was related to the already installed drivers: even when I only needed to install one specific Audio driver, I still needed to provide the other required drivers. For my machine, it was needed:
	</p>
		
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Quick Start: select DSDT free</li>
			<li>Drivers: <ul>
				<li>Audio: add ALC887/888b current</li>
				<li>Disk: add 10.9.4+ TRIM patch ( 3rd party SATA already selected )</li>
				<li>Graphics: nothing</li>
				<li>Misc: no changes (FakeSMC already selected)</li>
				<li>Network: Realtek: add RTL8111</li>
				<li>System: no changes ( AppleRTC patch already selected )</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Bootloaders: Chimera (already selected)</li>
			<li>Customize: No changes, already selected: <ul>
				<li>Basic Boot options</li>
				<li>Generate CPU states</li>
				<li>Hibernate mode -desktop</li>
				<li>Use kernel cache</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		Afterwards, all working perfectly. 
	</p>

		After using Mavericks for a short while, I discovered some odd behaviours: gmail would report network problems, suggesting me to use basic html pages, or Google Play Store would not proceed with any purchases. Checking the logs (/var/logs/system.log), one error was repeatedly reported:
	</p>
		<pre>Ethernet [RealtekRTL8111]: Tx timeout. Lost interrupt?</pre>
	<p>
		I run again Multibeast and changed the Ethernet driver, from Realtek RTL8111 to Realtek RTL81xx. This solved the networking issues. The full Multibeast configuration is now:

	<p>
		Checking the logs, I discovered one additional error, which had already appeared on my initial Mountain Lion installation: Sound assertions in AppleHDA*. This error does not seem to affect the normal behaviour of the sound system, but I tried replacing the Realtek ALCxxx audio driver with the VoodooHDA one; unfortunately, this didn't work at all, with the driver reporting no found devices. Back to the ALC887 driver.

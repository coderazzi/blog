 <p>This is my main web site, where most of my open source applications 
 are available. My main interest is on computer languages, including most
 functional and scripting languages and, definitely,
 more typical, C-based languages, including C++, C# and Java.</p>
 
 <p>I completed a PhD on Computer Sciences in 2002, related to fault
 tolerance; its dissertation is available in the 
 <a href='http://grasia.fdi.ucm.es/sensei'>project's web site</a>.
 My main studies have been, however, on Maths, Physics and Chemistry, but 
 I must still develop some related content in this site.</p>

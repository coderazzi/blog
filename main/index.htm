 <p> <img src='images/tablefilter.png' alt='table filter icon' class='left'/> 
 Spent some time updating <a href="tablefilter/index.html">Table Filter</a> to recover Java 1.5 compatibility. The time went, mostly, to uncover old bugs that were raising out of index exceptions. This becomes the version 2.2, which I expect to last... for a few days.</p>
 <p>The point is, that the filtering uses normal Swing controls -mainly comboboxes-, which render awfully in some platforms; in special, mixing different filtering modes makes the filter header look all but inconsistent, so I have worked for the last weeks on a custom filter editor, that should solve these
 issues. In addition, it adds some features, like autocompletion, and magically simplifies the API. It also breaks compatibility, and it looks, in general, like a completely new version, so I am investing some extra time to squeeze bugs and inconsistencies.</p>

 Huge. I hadn't read science fiction for quite a long time, and I was frankly rusty for the exhibition of imagination in this book, just amazing.</p>
<p>I am not sure what I really prefer: if the realism of the actions -interplanetary trips that take indeed months or years, the boredom during those trips-, the often used scientific explanations, the ironies and humor -these are robots, bored robots, even with existential problems-, or the erotism -yes, even with robots-.</p>
<p>Then, it comes the plot, as imaginative as the descriptions of unknown worlds, and really twisted. Of course, it is a plot where basic logical rules do not apply, so it is quite a challenge to follow.</p>

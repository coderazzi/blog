	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">2nd September 2012</span>PSU rampage</p> 
	 	<p> <img src="images/psu.jpg" alt="PSU" class="blog">Two weeks ago, one of my hackintoshes 
	 	started misbehaving. It would go to sleep, but the wakeup process never completed, even the 
	 	monitor would stay without line signal. I tried booting into Linux, but the same problem 
	 	reappeared, so it was a problem in the hardware. Didn't have much time to elucidate on the 
	 	possible reasons, as briefly after, the computer refused to start again. Better said, it 
	 	would start, auto power off and try to start again, without beeps or any screen information.</p>

	 	<p>These <a href='http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findbysymptom/tp/computer-wont-turn-on.htm'>website</a> 
	 		was my best reference, specially
	 		<a href='http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findbysymptom/ht/pconthenoff.htm'>How To Troubleshoot 
	 			a Computer That Turns On and Then Immediately Turns Off</a>.
	 		The problem seemed to be on the power supply, so I quickly opened my other hackintosh, and 
	 		plugged its power supply into the dead computer: immediate success, time to change the power supply.</p>

	 	<p>The guilty PSU was a <span class='mark'>Be Quiet 300 Watts</span>, about 3 years old.
	 	   I failed to check the manufacturer warranty, which (at least now) covers 5 years,
	 	   and without considerations on buying for second time a PSU of the same brand I purchased a 
	 	   <span class='mark'>Be Quiet 350 Watts</span>. Plugged in -of course having to disassembly
	 	   almost completely the computer-, and working again without (further) problems.</p>

		<p>Matter is, my other hackintosh PSU's broke down just a couple of weeks later!</p>

		<p>This time there were no symptoms that the guilty component would be the PSU, and I could 
			not plug the other PSU this time -I needed a P4+4 connector, missing on the 
			<span class='mark'>Be Quiet 350 W</span>-. Fortunately I had a voltmeter and with the
			help of this 
			<a href='http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/ht/power-supply-test-multimeter.htm'>reference page</a>
			I was able to quickly verify that my +12 VDC line was supplying 12.92 volts, 
			outside the ATX safety margin.</p>

		<p>Again, time to shopping; my previous PSU was a 
			<span class='mark'>Cooler Master Silent Pro M500</span> (500W), with single rail. 
			This single rail was rather problematic -To swap hard disks using the hard disk rack 
			I had to put first the computer on standby-, so I did first some googling to find the best alternative. 
			The best help I found was a <a href='http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp'>calculator</a> 
			to find the required power for my system, but at the end I had to buy what my local dealer had in stock: 
			a <span class='mark'>Be Quiet PCGH Edition</span> -500W, 80 Plus Gold-.</p>

		<p>So, 100 euros poorer I could only wonder why both PSUs would die in such a short time. 
			Initially I thought it would be due to letting the computers on suspend mode (aka hibernating for Windows), 
			but this should not shorten specially the lifespan of the PSUs -in addition, one PSU was about 4 years old, 
			the other 3 years old-. Other cause would be a voltage spike, but I do use surge protectors -Belkin- and 
			seem to be working properly, so I haven't yet ruled out having had just very bad luck.

	 <p> <img src="images/gimp.png" alt="gimp icon" class="blog">
	 	For a website I am developing, I wanted to use an image map where the user could specify a given position.
	 	The image would be simple, just small circles on predefined positions, and the user would need to select just one such circle.
	 	This seemed a very suitable scenario to use PythonFu, the scripting language in GIMP that allows to create images
	 	programmatically (or alter them, or define plugins).</p>

	 	<p>The lack of documentation (and experience) made the experiment longer than required, but it was a great way to
	 	get into PythonFu. <a href='python/gimp/pythonfu.html'>Here</a> is the script that I created, together with the
	 	associated javascript and my comments on the whole experience.</p>

	 New version, <a href='tablefilter/index.html'>4.4.0</a>, for the library.</p>
	 <p>It is a minor update, although some interfaces are updated, hereby the version bump. The release focuses on the capability

	 	restore the filter's history, and the classes supporting custom choices implement now the Serializable interface.</p>

	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">12th July 2012</span>Sublime Text 2 and .erb formatting</p> 

	<p><img src='images/sublime.png' alt="Sublime Text 2" class='blog'/>
		For the last weeks, I have been using the editor <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a>, and I find it
		rather good, with the huge improvement over <a href='http://macromates.com/'>TextMate</a> of being cross platform. 
		Obviously Emacs or Vi have already this advantage, but after many years using them and being at best only 
		semi-proficient, I am really open to use other editors.</p>

	<p>The plugin architecture is great, and after installing the required <a href='http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control'>package control plugin</a>, it was time to start enhancing the editor -check this <a href='http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/sublime-text-2-tips-and-tricks/'>link</a> for some tips on using this editor-.</p>

	<p>Sublime copes obviously with .html files, but it lacks an auto formatter. I installed 
		<a href='https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-HTMLPrettify'>Sublime-HTMLPrettify</a>, that formats properly .html files,
		but alas, the rather requivalent .html.erb files are left untouched. The solution is just to edit the file 
		<span class='mark'>run.js</span>, located in Packages/Sublime-HTMLPrettify/scripts and convert the lines:</p>
<pre>if (source.match(".html" + "$") == ".html") {
	log(style_html(data, option));
}
else if (source.match(".css" + "$") == ".css") {
	log(cssbeautify(data, option));
}</pre>
      <p>into:</p>
<pre>if (source.match(".html" + "$") == ".html") {
	log(style_html(data, option));
}
else if (source.match(".html.erb" + "$") == ".html.erb") {
	log(style_html(data, option));
}
else if (source.match(".css" + "$") == ".css") {
	log(cssbeautify(data, option));
}</pre>
	
	<p>Obviously it just formats the .html.erb as pure html file, but so far seems fine to me.</p>

	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">12th July 2012</span>Recovering SVN revisions</p> 

	<p><img src='images/rsync.png' alt="Rsync" class='blog'/>
		For my current development, I am using SVN repositories hosted at <a href='http://www.sliksvn.com/'>slik subversion</a>, 
			but I still keep some older respositories on my own server -precisely
			the server that crashed badly last weekend-; with backups rather up to date, the recovery was rather fast, and I was only
			faced with some checkouts that were now desynchronized: that is, on my development machine I had a revision that was newer
			than expected, and I could just not commit the changes.
	</p>

	<p>With <span class='mark'>rsync</span>, the solution was very easy: checkout the most updated version from the server, and
		synchronized the version on my development machine, ensuring that the .svn files where untouched:</p>

<pre>svn checkout REPOSITORY website.svn
cp -R website website.backup                      #just in case
find website -name ".svn" -exec rm -Rf \{\} \;    #error messages can be NORMALLY dismissed
rsync -vr website/ website.svn/</pre>

	<p><img src='images/nginx.gif' alt="NGinx" class='blog'/>
		<a href='howto/osx/nginx.html'>Installing Nginx in Osx</a> should be as easy as downloading the available source distribution, and compiling it;
		the only issue in OsX is that Nginx requires PCRE (Perl compatible regular expressions), and this library

		addition to <a href='http://nginx.org/en/download.html'>nginx</a>, uncompress both files into 
	    any temporal folders, and type:</p>

	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">9th February 2012</span>ICS on Galaxy S</p> 

	<p> <img src='images/galaxys.png' alt="Samsung Galaxy S i9000 icon" class='blog'/>
		On my Galaxy S I9000 I had installed <a href='http://www.darkyrom.com'>DarkyRom</a> 
		quite a long time ago, and, overall, I was pretty satisfied with the speed and usability. 
		I had replaced the launcher with the excellent ADWLauncher EX, and using the SwiftKey X keyboard, plus, 
		of course, customizations on the themes, icons, etc. 
		However, I was experiencing lately too many application crashes, so I decided to get some more stable ROM.</p>
		
	<p> After considering the <a href='http://miuiandroid.com/'>MIUI</a> and 
		<a href='http://www.cyanogenmod.com/'>cyanogenmod</a> ROMs, I backed up the system and 
		installed the stable mod of Cyanogenmod (CM7). But even applying the extra download for 
		Google apps, I could not get GMail installed -or any of the Google apps-. After a 
		reinstallation -fast and painless, but also fruitless-, I planned to try the MIUI ROM... 
		but then decided on the experimental Cyanogenmod CM9 based on ICS.</p>
		
	<p>	The XDA <a href='http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1363593'>forum</a>, plus this 
		<a href='http://www.theandroidsoul.com/cyanogenmod-9-cm9-by-teamhacksung-for-galaxy-s-i9000-ics-android-4-0-3/'>page</a>
		provided the complete information to download and install it. So I have been running it now for 
		a few days (build 15) and it works fantastic. </p>
		
	<p> As most reviews point out, ICS looks and behaves much greater than Gingerbread (I have not seen any
		Honeycomb device); but overall, it looks initially like a subtle refinement on the GUI. However,
		these refinements just kept summing up, until I realized that I was greatly impressed with it.
		And much of this effect is due to the Roboto font, indeed.</p>
		
	<p> Then, the added bonus of having (finally) a Chrome version on Android is just priceless.
		And even better, knowing that my 2 years old phone is handling it properly; I cannot 
		recommend it enough, to install and try this version on the Galaxy S. I bet it will stay, only
		to be eventually replaced by a later beta or the final CM9 version.

	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">22nd December 2011</span>Ubuntu server as Windows service</p> 
	
	<p> <img src="images/wubuntu.jpg" alt="table filter icon" class="blog">
	I had recently to setup a server to host a Rails application. What initially should
	had been a simple task, developed some complications when the whole setup was included,
	considering backups, etc. The initial complication was the operative system, as the
	server was running Windows 7 Professional, and Rails presents some allergy symptoms on
	that environment.</p>
	<p>So I first installed Ubuntu Server as a virtual machine, and then associated it to
		a windows service, to enable its automatically start / shutdown. This is, in fact,
		a very useful setup, so I decided to describe it in detail here:

	 <p> <img src="images/tablefilter.png" alt="table filter icon" class="blog">
	 New version, <a href='tablefilter/index.html'>4.2.0</a>, for the library.</p>

	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">11th November 2011</span>Domains</p> 

	<p> <img src='images/domains.jpg' class='blog'/>
		I first applied for a domain name in 2006; in that moment I requested a personal one, using Yahoo as
		registrar, and another one for a company in Spain. 
	</p>
	
	<p>Yahoo's web interface was very easy to use, but
		after two years they increased the registry price like 300%, to 35$ per year. 
		I dumped them immediately, but they really took their time to transfer my domain, 
		which was unavailable for about 2 weeks. A company
		could not (should not) afford this downtime, so my respect for Yahoo decreased many levels.
	</p>
	
	<p>I transferred my domain to <a href='http://www.namecheap.com/'>Namecheap</a>. 
		I have no idea of marketing, but the name of the registrar seems
		definitely wrong to me. And there is nothing cheap with the service, as I have only praise for them. 
		I regularly read complains on bad support, and I have never needed contacting them, so I cannot 
		comment on that, but their website is fast, and provides all the means to perform all required 
		operations with the domain, and the knowledge database has been always enough to
		answer my doubts. I have been able to setup dynamic DNS, forwarding of emails, etc, plus, of course, 
		the more usual basic domain maintenance. 
	</p>
	
	<p>	When last week I wanted to get a new domain, I checked other sites, and 
		<a href='http://www.godaddy.com/'>GoDaddy</a> would have saved  me a few bucks over a 5 years period, 
		but I preferred to stick to Namecheap. It is definitely better to have a single site to control your 
		domains as different registrars provide very different mechanisms to provide the same functionality. 
		In retrospect, perhaps I should have tried GoDaddy to check their support and service, but well, too late now.
	</p>
	
	<p>5 months ago, my brother in law dumped unceremoniously his webmaster, asking me to take over. 
		His webmaster retained the website -which went down, of course-, and didn't transfer the domain's name. 
		Whether this is legal or moral helps little to have a website up again in short time, so we
		decided on acquiring a new domain name. My brother in law gave me several names that he wanted to 
		register, and told me the registrar (<a href='http://www.arsys.es/'>Arsys.es</a>) to use, 
		one which had been recommended to him. I checked their prices, and at 25 euros/year I couldn't imagine why someone 
		with good intentions would recommend them.
	</p>

	<p>Seriously: a registrar work is rather limited:<ul>
		<li>Ensure proper registration.</li>
		<li>Provide as many payment options as possible.</li>
		<li>Ensure that all functionality is reachable via their website, and this website to be fast.</li>
		<li>In addition, bonuses included provide dynamic DNS, email handling, etc.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>Namecheap provides this functionality -with all the bonuses- for 8 euros per year. I could expect to 
		have sites offering better prices, and perhaps, less funcionality, so I wonder at these sites expecting 
		25 euros (or 35 euros, in the case of Yahoo). This is not at all advertising to use Namecheap, I just wonder 
		why there are users using other registrars offering (much) less bang for the buck.
		And even recommend them on good will.

	<p> <img src='images/crunchbang.png' class='blog'/>
	
		I have been running for a while <a href='http://crunchbanglinux.org/'>Crunchbang</a> 
		as my desktop Linux distribution, and
		despite some rough edges, I am quite happy with my choice.</p>

	<p>I decided today to use it as well on a new system, and my first problem happened
	directly on the installation, with complains that the cdrom media could not be
	loaded [effectively, I was trying to install using a usb stick, the target system
	hadn't even a cdrom!]. I pressed Alt-F2 to activate a terminal and solved it entered
	(being /dev/sdb my usb stick):</p>

	<pre>mount -t vfat /dev/sdb /cdrom</pre>

	<p>This was enough to continue the installation process (pressing
		Alt-F1 to get back from the terminal)</p>

	<p>The installation process had some more rough edges: when a prompt appeared to
	request the timezone, only America options were available (after my mistake, 
	when I introduced American as my locale, trying to get the proper configuration 
	for my US keyboard); to get other options is needed to change the locale, 
	but then there is no option to get back to the timezone! 
	Alas, the solution is easy, enough to reconfigure the timezone:</p>

	<pre>sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</pre>

	<p>Then, some options to configure Crunchbang:</p>

	<ul><span class='mark'>Enable autologin</span>:System -> GDM login setup -> Security -> Enable automatic login</ul>
	<ul><span class='mark'>Enable suspend</span>:Settings -> Power manager ->General: When power button is pressed -> Suspend</ul>

	 for subwoofer and side speakers, and everything works if the green jack (line out) is 
	 disconnected and then reconnected: not the best solution, as it must be done after any 
	 reboot or sleep cycle. Alternatively, disconnecting all jacks but the green one solves 
	 also the problem.</p>
	 
	<p>A real, solid solution is going to require working on the DSDT or the info.plist, once I

	not to do not remember even the brand, although I would bet on Sanyo).<br>
	
	The 30" monitor is about 4 times bigger, in viewable size. The resolution
	difference ist just massive; I used a ZX Spectrum on the 14" TV, with a 
	resolution of 256x192, which relates quite well to the 2560x1600 resolution
	of the new monitor: 10 times more pixels horizontally, above 8 times more
	vertically.<br>
	
	Which means that a pixel on the 30" monitor is about 25% smaller than on the
	14" TV.<br>
	
	But this is nothing compared to using the very same ZX Spectrum on any of
	the current 56" LCDs. Something must look really wrong when a pixel measures
	almost 1/2 cm on a side. And 56" is not at all among the biggest sizes, so . . .<br>

	<p> <img src='images/hackintosh.png' alt='hackintosh icon' class='blog'/>10.6.7 update had
	no problems on the P5N7A-VM hackintosh, the one usually giving problems: sound, USB, sleep,
	everything working after update, great.<br>
	The other hackintosh, with P5Q-E mobo is currently enjoying a Crunchbang distribution, so 
	the 10.6.7 udate will have to wait for some reboot . . .</p>
	
	
	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">16th March 2011</span>Does age matters?</p> 

	 <p> <img src="images/age.jpg" alt="age matters icon" class="blog">
	 Investigoogling, for whatever reasons, I find often articles exhibiting no date. 
	 In many cases, such omission is non important, let's say, for example, a review of the Ipad. 
	 It is bound to be an article from 2010, right? Anyway, it is meaningful if the review is done 
	 just after the product was delivered, or it is a mature review, highligthing usability issues 
	 after a long contact period.</p>

	<p>So I cannot stop wondering the reasons why some article or blog would omit the 
	dictation / publishing date, specially if such omission seems deliberated. 
	For example, in PcMagazine, I find always entertaining, and some times interesting, 
	the articles from <a href='http://www.pcmag.com/author_bio/0,1908,a%253D123,00.asp'>John C. Dvorak</a>; 
	they seems to be always properly dated. But then, the very same magazine provides 
	entries without any visible date. For example, this recent page called 
	<a href='http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/261776/albert-einstein-seven-things-you-didn-t-know'>
	Albert Einstein: Seven Things You Didn't Know</a>: it has no date at all; so the line 
	<span class='mark'>'Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on this date in 1879'</span> 
	has definitely less information than expected. <note>Update: date included on original article</note>. 
	Perhaps the author didn't really know 
	on which date Einstein was born, or was unaware on the date he was writing the story, 
	but seems, anyway, a deliberate mistake.</p>

	<p>This problem is specially acute for those cases where the target is to find a solution 
	to a technical problem. Let's say, Linux is misbehaving and a Grub entry is missing: 
	because of rapid evolution, a solution from 2008 will be, probably, totally useless 
	by now, but, if the googled entry has no date, the googleer can try, in vane, the 
	obsolete solution. Certainly, Google allows limiting the search to specific periods in time 
	(see <a href='http://www.gtricks.com/google-tricks/how-to-criteria-limit-search-past-date-year/'>this gtrick</a>), 
	and such search is in fact more trusty than relying on the article's date, but 
	it lets me wondering all the same on the reasons to let a post undated.

	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">15th March 2011</span>TableFilter v4.1.1</p> 

	 <p> <img src="images/tablefilter.png" alt="table filter icon" class="blog">
	 After a long time implementing the changes for version 4.0, there were lots of minor details that could enhance the
	 usability of the library. <a href='tablefilter/index.html'>Version 4.1</a> goes in this direction, implementing 
	 instant filtering, full autocompletion, feedback to
	 the user when the filters hide all table rows, and some more changes.</p>
	 <p>Available already on the central maven repositories.</p>

	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">16th February 2011</span>TableFilter v4.0.0</p> 

	 <p> <img src='images/tablefilter.png' alt='table filter icon' class='blog'/>
	 New version for this <a href='tablefilter/index.html'>Java swing</a> library; the functionality is greatly expanded, to better cover the choices
	 available to the user on each editor, but the changes have implied a major rewriting of the library.</p>
	 <p>On the negative side, the API is incompatible with previous versions, although I would not expect
		major headaches with any migration.</p>
	 <p>Available already on the central maven repositories.</p>

	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">13th January 2011</span>WebM and my two cents</p> 

	<p> <img src='images/chrome.png' class='blog'/>I read with some dismay the news of Chrome ditching H.264, 
	although I could not point the reasons causing the discomfort. Finally, I have identified them: 
	I disliked the aggresiveness of the movement, but, is it really aggressive?</p>

	<p> Chrome lags behind Firefox and Explorer on maket share; removing H.264 support from Chrome should 
	have much less impact than the movement of Apple removing flash support. If any user wants to see 
	H.264 video can default to other browsers, which is definitely not an option on iOs devices.</p>

	<p> However, it also states a message: Google against H.264. Some people has called Google hypocrite, 
	by not going the full route -ditching also Flash, removing H.264 support from youtube, and Android, 
	removing also support for other close technologies like AAC audio-, but that is what will most 
	likely happen in the future. In this moment, H.264 (or WebM) are not full replacements for flash, 
	so flash is still needed; youtube? removing H.264 support today is losing, immediately, many visitors. 
	But, more important: it is aggressive, it is evil. It is enough to state the message: 
	H.264 will likely be not supported in the future, check the alternatives. </p>

	<p> And, it is needed this movement? In fact, yes; H.264 is still a nascent way to provide videos on the 
	Web via de HTML5 video tag-specification not yet even approuved-. 
	Once, a similar problem happened with GIF images, which were not royalty free, so the PNG format was 
	developed. In that moment, dropping support for GIF images would have been a too late move, rendering 
	unaccesible many sites. If GIF and PNG format had been made available at the same time, dropping GIF
	support would have been the obvious move. So the obvious move now seems to be dropping the H.264 encoding.</p>

	<p> Aggresive? In fact, cautious.</p>

	<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">11th January 2011</span>Hackintosh, 10.6.6</p> 

	<p> <img src='images/hackintosh.png' alt='hackintosh icon' class='blog'/>10.6.6 update worked really 
	fine on my both hackintoshes. Usually, I must reinstall some Kext to recover USB, Audio or Networking 
	functionality, but this time no additional hacking was required. The cynic in me wonders if Apple 
	doesn't wanna facilitate hackintoshing, to better sell applications through the new App Store. Nah!...</p>

 An auto-referent book, where the motifs behind it are part of the book itself, and the book seems totally alien to the story is trying to tell. That's it, I am more drawn to the style of the book than to the story that it tells, or that it intends to tell.</p>

<p>You see, the main point of the book is the story behind, the bombing of Dresden, and the unnecessary death of far more people than Hiroshima or Nagasaki killed. But what I remember from the book is the style, the prose of Vonnegut, his way to tell things. I guess I am just another Tralfamadorian, able to watch the Earthling Zoo, thinking that there is nothing to solve. I pay full tribute to the cleverness of this book, although it still failed to move me.</p>
 
 
<p class="entry"><span class="entry-date">12th April 2010</span>TableFilter v2.2.0</p> 
  
 <p> <img src='images/tablefilter.png' alt='table filter icon' class='left'/> 
 Spent some time updating <a href="tablefilter/index.html">Table Filter</a> to recover Java 1.5 compatibility. The time went, mostly, to uncover old bugs that were raising out of index exceptions. This becomes the version 2.2, which I expect to last... for a few days.</p>
 <p>The point is, that the filtering uses normal Swing controls -mainly comboboxes-, which render awfully in some platforms; in special, mixing different filtering modes makes the filter header look all but inconsistent, so I have worked for the last weeks on a custom filter editor, that should solve these
 issues. In addition, it adds some features, like autocompletion, and magically simplifies the API. It also breaks compatibility, and it looks, in general, like a completely new version, so I am investing some extra time to squeeze bugs and inconsistencies.</p>

 Huge. I hadn't read science fiction for quite a long time, and I was frankly rusty for the exhibition of imagination in this book, just amazing.</p>
<p>I am not sure what I really prefer: if the realism of the actions -interplanetary trips that take indeed months or years, the boredom during those trips-, the often used scientific explanations, the ironies and humor -these are robots, bored robots, even with existential problems-, or the erotism -yes, even with robots-.</p>
<p>Then, it comes the plot, as imaginative as the descriptions of unknown worlds, and really twisted. Of course, it is a plot where basic logical rules do not apply, so it is quite a challenge to follow.</p>

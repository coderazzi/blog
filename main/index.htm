     <p class="blog-entry"><span class="blog-entry-date">10th November 2016</span>TableFilter v5.3.0</p>

     <p> <img src="images/tablefilter.png" alt="table filter icon" class="blog">New release for this
         <a href='tablefilter/index.html'>Java library</a>, implementing some requested functionality: the possibility
         to filter entries that <b>contain</b> some text -initially, the default operator would only display entries
         starting with a given expression

     <p class="blog-entry"><span class="blog-entry-date">21st March 2016</span>VirtualBox guest additions on headless</p>

     <p> <img src="images/vbox.png" alt="virtualbox" class="blog"> Normally, I run virtualbox machines in headless mode,
         so it is useless installing an OS with full GUI. I favor in this cases a debian installation (minimal, using
         the netinst CD), and ensuring that PAE/NX is enabled in System/Processor.
     </p><p>
        It is still helpful to install the virtualbox guest additions to improve the performance, but the usual way
        -Devices/Install Guest Additions CD Image...- doesn't work. In this case, the best procedure is to download them
        and perform a manual install. For the current version, 5.0.16:
     </p>

     <pre>cd /tmp
wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.16/VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.16.iso
mkdir iso
sudo -s
apt-get install -y dkms
mount -o loop VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.16.iso iso
sh iso/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run --nox11
umount iso
rm -Rf iso VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.16.iso</pre>

     <p>This will install the extensions, and produce a final warning:</p>
     <pre>Could not find the X.Org or XFree86 Window System, skipping.</pre>
     <p>This warning is okay. It is possible to check if the additions are installed by invoking:</p>
     <pre>lsmod | grep vboxguest</pre>


	 <p class="blog-entry"><span class="blog-entry-date">20th March 2016</span>Rclone</p>

	 <p> <img src="images/rclone.jpg" alt="rclone" class="blog"> A few years ago, I setup a poor man backup system for a
         site using <b>rsync</b> and <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx'>Dropbox</a>.
         Eventually, the database and associated files required more than 2 Gb, and still following the poor man habits,
         I had a look at <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/>"gdrive</a>; unfortunately, Google does not have
         an official headless linux client.
     </p>
     <p>
         But there are several unofficial clients. Like <a href="https://github.com/iwonbigbro/gsync">gsync</a>,
         which tries to provide rsync functionality, being still severely limited. I opted better for other client,
         <a href="http://rclone.org/">rclone</a>, which does not only support GDrive, but also Dropbox, Amazon S3,
         Backblaze, etc. The documentation is very complete, the setup really simple, and its functionality covers all
         my scenarios.
     </p>
		 Installation instructions only cover directly Linux, and for some reason it puts the executable into <b>sbin</b>,
         which is all but useful -the idea is to be executed, with different credentials, by each user. Finally, I used
         the following instructions for Linux:
	 </p>

     <pre>cd /tmp
wget http://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-v1.28-linux-amd64.zip
unzip cd rclone-v1.28-linux-amd64.zip

sudo cp rclone-v1.28-linux-amd64/rclone /usr/local/bin
sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/rclone
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/rclone

#install manpage
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1
sudo cp rclone-v1.28-linux-amd64/rclone.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
sudo mandb
rm -Rf rclone-v1.18-linux-amd64*</pre>

     </p>
         And almost the same instructions for OsX:
     </p>

     <pre>cd /tmp
wget http://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-v1.28-osx-amd64.zip
unzip rclone-v1.28-osx-amd64.zip

sudo cp rclone-v1.28-osx-amd64/rclone /usr/local/bin
sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin/rclone
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/rclone

#install manpage
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1
sudo cp rclone-v1.28-osx-amd64/rclone.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
rm -Rf rclone-v1.18-osx-amd64*</pre>

	 <p> <img src="images/redmine.png" alt="redmine icon" class="blog"> Added

	 	The main problem was in fact setting up correctly email support (and then, trying to scape the SPAM folders in Google).

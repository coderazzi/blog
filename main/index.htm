 <p>This is my main web site, where most of my open source applications 
 are available. I am mostly interested on Python, C#, and Erlang, although
 my main background is on C++ and Java.</p>
 
 <p>I completed a PhD on Computer Sciences in 2002, related to fault
 tolerance; its dissertation is available in the 
 <a href='http://grasia.fdi.ucm.es/sensei'>project's web site</a>.
 My main studies have been, however, on Maths, Physics and Chemistry, but 
 I must still develop some related content in this site. The same applies to
 Python or C++, where all my work has envolved professional projects and
 I can't open source it. So most of the content available in this site
 is only related to Java and C#.
 </p>
 
 <p>Some of the applications, specially in Java, are plain old.
 Probably the least useful nowadays is a <a href='menu/index.htm'>menu applet</a>
 that I created in 1997 to put some charme to my
 old webpages. In any case, there are also available other applications (a bit) more useful.
 Please note, quoting Kjell Magne Bondevik, that <span class='note'>A person's worth is quite independent 
 of their usefulness to society</span>.</p>

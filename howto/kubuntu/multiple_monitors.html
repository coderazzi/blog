 <h1>Setup multiple monitors on Kubuntu (Nvidia)</h1>

 <p>Assuming that the nvidia drivers are installed, it is needed to open the <span class='mark'>NVIDIA X Server Settings</span>,
	located in the Applications / Settings menu.</p>
	
 <p>On the left panel of the shown window, click on the <span class='mark'>X Server Display Configuration</span> option, that should
	show all the attached screens. By now, only one should be enabled, so click on the disabled one and press the 
	<span class='mark'>Configure...</span> button: select now the <span class='mark'>TwinView</span> option, press Ok, select the correct
	position (left / right) from the main window, and then apply the changes.</p>
	
 <p>Both screens should be now enabled, and the mouse should move around as expected (specially moving left/right). However, these changes
	only last for the current session, will be lost as soon as the XServer is restarted. To make the changes persistent, press now the
	<span class='mark'>Save to X Configuration File</span> button.</p>
	
 <p>Somehow, the offered changes are not what they should be, it is better to handle the changes manually (it only implies adding two
	lines to the configuration file). Press the <span class='mark'>Show preview...</span> button, and pay attention to the 
	<span class='mark'>Section &quot;Screen&quot;</span>: it will contain two lines, looking like:</p>
<pre>Option		"TwinView" "1"
Option		"metamodes" "DFP-0: nvidia-auto-select +1680+0, DFP-1: nvidia-auto-select +0+0"</pre>

 <p>The second line will depend on your exact settings.	In this example, it means that the main window is located 
	at position 1680:0, and the additional monitor is on its left (1680 being my resolution width).</p>
	
 <p>Open then the <span class='mark'>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</span> file and add these two lines into the 
	Section &quot;Screen&quot;. After this change, I would still like to have my configuration automatically 
	updated, so I execute, as detailed on the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file:</p>
	
 <pre>sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-org</pre>

 <p>My own configuration file, without the initial comments, looks like:</p>

<pre>Section "Monitor"
	Identifier	"Configured Monitor"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"Default Screen"
	Monitor		"Configured Monitor"
	Device		"Configured Video Device"
	DefaultDepth	24
	Option		"TwinView" "1"
	Option		"metamodes" "DFP-0: nvidia-auto-select +1680+0, DFP-1: nvidia-auto-select +0+0"
EndSection

Section "Module"
	Load	"glx"
EndSection

Section "Device"
	Identifier	"Configured Video Device"
	Driver	"nvidia"
	Option	"NoLogo"	"True"
EndSection</pre>

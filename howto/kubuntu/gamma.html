 <p class='timestamp'>17th March 2010</p> <h1>Calibrating screen's color</h1>

 <p class='note'>This entry applies specifically to Kubuntu 10.04; 
	<span class='mark'>probably</span> also to later releases and
	alternate Linux distributions</p>

 <p>This setup is only needed if you really care for color accuracy, or if you have more than one monitor, and their models do not match.
	In this case, a color can look quite different on separate monitors, which can be specially bothering in some cases. 	
 </p>

 <p>Some monitors have many configuration settings. I focus here on the bare bones: brightness, contrast, and gamma correction (the 
	correlation between a color value and its representation on the screen). Brightness and contrast are usually setup using the monitor
	settings, while the gamma value usually require specific software setup. More to the point, whatever is the gamma correction defined
	in the monitor settings, it is usually modified by the software setup: by default, Os X and Windows apply a gamma correction of 2.2
	(which is applied over the correction defined by the monitor itself, no overriding here).
 </p>

 <p>I am unsure on how Ubuntu defines the gamma value. There is a command: <span class='mark'>xgamma</span> that shows the applied gamma,
	and is, by default, 1.0. However, this does not corresponds to the reality (as far as I can gather, this xgamma 1.0 value corresponds
	to a 2.0 value). The best help here is using calibration tools, which can be as simple as checking some images.</p>
	
 <p>These <a href='http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/gamma_calibration.php'>pages</a> will show the current gamma value. I personally favor a
	value of 1.8, which seems to correspond to a <span class='mark'>xgamma=1.3</span> value. It is easy to try different values using the command:</p>
	
<pre>xgamma -gamma=x.y</pre>

 <p>It is better to apply different gamma values and see the results on the 
	<a href='http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/black.php'>black</a> and <a href='http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/white.php'>white</a> levels.</p>
	
 <p>Once the desired xgamma value is calculated, it is needed to update the <span class='mark'>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</span> file, adding the
	gamma value into the &quot;monitor&quot; section. In my case, it ends looking up like:</p>
	
<pre>Section "Monitor"
	Identifier 	"Configured Monitor"
	Gamma		1.3
EndSection</pre>

 <p>Please note that it is possible to apply different gamma values to the red / green / blue channels. After this change, I would still like to have my configuration automatically 
	updated, so I execute, as detailed on the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file:</p>
 <pre>sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-org</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not enough. If the X server is restarted, the xgamma command will report a 1.3 gamma value. But, if now the 
   command is reissued:</p>

<pre>xgamma -gamma=1.3</pre>

<p>The gamma correction is <span class='mark'>then</span> applied: that is, the gamma had not been properly corrected yet. There seems
	to be some problem with the gamma value applied by the display driver itself. In my case, using NVidia, there is a panel
	-NVidia X Server settings- that displays, among others, the gamma correction, and which does not match the value reported by
	xgamma. As far as I have gathered, it is needed to update both values: the nvidia settings and the Xorg.conf value (in fact I 
	am afraid that all is needed is to update the nvidia settings). When this is done, a file is created on the home directory,
	<span class='mark'>.nvidia-settings-rc</span>, containing the given gamma values.</p>

 <p>So, the right procedure for NVidia drivers is:<ol>
		<li>Open the NVidia X Server Settings, and set a gamma value of 1.3. Exit the settings; a file will have been created on the
			home directory, <span class='mark'>.nvidia-settings-rc</span>, containing the given gamma values</li>
		<li>Edit the <span class='mark'>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</span> file, as detailed above.</li>
		<li>Reboot (restarting the X server is enough).</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

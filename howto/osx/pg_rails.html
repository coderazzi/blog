<h1>PostgreSQL and Rails</h1>

<p>The official PostgreSQL gem for rails is <a href='http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-pg'>ruby-pg</a>. Its installation includes native extensions that require the development version of PostgreSQL to be installed on the target machine. This in a requirement easy to accomplish in Debian installations: <span class='code'>apt-get install libpq-dev</span>, but in OsX the speediest method is to install directly PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://www.postgresql.org/download/'>distribution</a> of PostgreSQL includes a binary package for Os X, which simplifies the installation and setup of a PostgreSQL database in Os X. However, it also modifies the memory settings in the machine and install a database server, so the devlopment machine ends being a proper server -with additional daemons running full time-.</p>

<p>In many cases this is not required: perhaps a laptop used for casual development, or perhaps the development environment implies already a test database running on a separate machine. For these cases, the best alternative is to download the source code and compile it:</p>

<pre>./configure
make
sudo make install</pre>

<p>Which gets PostgreSQL installed under <span class='code'>/usr/local/pgsql</span>. This path (<span class='code'>/usr/local/pgsql/bin</span>) must now be included in the PATH environment variable. Then, installing the ruby gem is as easy as typing:</p>
<pre>gem install pg</pre>

<p>Although easy, this solution pollutes the <span class='code'>/usr/local/</span> area, so a cleaner alternative is to install it in a separate directory:</p>

<pre>./configure --prefix=TARGET_FOLDER
make
make install</pre>

<p>And TARGET_FOLDER/bin must be added now to the environment PATH variable.</p>

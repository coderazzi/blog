	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Lev Grossman</span>, narrated by <span class="mark">Mark Bramhall</span>, unabridged version, 
		16h 27m, released by Penguin Audio the 5th August 2014.
	</p><p>
		I got borrowed this audiobook, without noticing that it is the last book of a trilogy. The story is anyway rather complete, and although I started wondering early enough if I was not missing parts of the story, it was only after half the book that I fully realized my mistake.
	</p><p>
		The story is alright, fantasy and magic in full gear, nicely complemented by the narrator, who did a great job adopting all the voices. But is also a bit lacking, almost never capturing my full attention. The passages of the book that I found more interesting had no fantasy within, they were mere descriptions of actions and situations, but they were really worthful.

		By <span class="mark">iain M. banks</span>, 470 pages, published by Abacus, 2010 (978-0-349-11927-4).
	</p><p>
		Science fiction, and quite different from his Culture novels. Worlds within worlds, Banks at its best exploding his own imagination, describing multiple scenarios and actions in parallel. 
	</p><p>
		It is not a complicated book, and the story's concept is interesting. Fast pace at times, then excruciatingly slow at others where philosophy kicks in. Perhaps too much philosophy for the kind of book, and not the kind that makes me thinking, but overall a brilliant and solid book.

	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Peter Clines</span>, narrated by <span class="mark">Ray Porter</span>, unabridged version, 
		12h 38m, released by Audible Studios the 15th July 2014.
	</p><p>
		Great plot -rather original-, very likeable characters -but very artificial- and a good rhythm define this book, with a horror line wrapped in science fiction. 
	</p><p>
		The story is definitely intriguing, and the atmosphere crescendo is a continuos invitation to turn pages (or in my case, to keep listening the audio). It makes me think of Stephen King, but without (yet), his fabulous storytelling; And I will surely search now for other books from Peter Clines.

	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Nick Hornby</span>, 250 pages, published by the Penguin Group, 2009 (978-0-670-915651).
	</p><p>
		Loving disagreements abound, all the associated sadness gets diluted with enormous measures of humour. Some situations and characters are extreme, bizarre, which obviously helps the comic angles of the book; on the other side, feelings and thoughts are exposed in all honesty.
	</p><p>
		It is a book without nostalgia, but with a lot of looking back. But it doesn't invite to melancholy, or to meditation, just to laugh and to enjoy a good read.

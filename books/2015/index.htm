	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Alastair Reynolds</span>, 592 pages, published by Ace -reprint edition- the 28th May 2002 (978-0441009428).
	</p><p>
		This is heavyweight. I started this book a few years ago and I didn't pass the 30 pages mark. This time, I almost dropped it after 125 pages, and that would have been a great mistake. 
	</p><p>
		This book is really a jewel, it elevates cyberpunk scenarios like Snowcrash to the n-th power, drawing very powerful scenarios, totally alien, that could very easily happen when the technology advances enough: it just represents obvious, logic conclusions of what can once happens, after machines reach the artificial intelligence that we are so busy trying to program today. 
	</p><p>
		And cyberpunk is only a part, the control of relativistic concepts, the continuos warping of space and time that Reynolds makes is exemplar, all set together into one unforgettable fiction story, with a mind-numbingly interesting plot.

		By <span class="mark">Ken Follet</span>, 928 pages, published by Signet -second edition- the 26th August 2014 (978-0-451-46822-2).
	</p><p>
		What can I say here? Just make yourself a favour and read this book. Is not only very entertaining, but its historical value is superb -not serious history, mind you, but exact historical representation is second need if it makes us relive, relearn our close history-.

<h2><a name='revival'>Revival: a Novel</a> 
   <img src="../recommended5.gif" alt="5 out of 10"></h2>

	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Stephen King</span>, narrated by <span class="mark">David Morse</span>, unabridged version, 13h 22m, released by Hodder &amp; Stoughton the 11th November 2014.
	</p><p>
		I have been enjoying many books form Stephen King lately, so it was just a matter of probability to find the rotten one. Of course, the impression that books leave behind depends a lot of the reader himself, and, unfortunately for audiobooks, the narrator can also degrade the experience of an book all the same: Revival is a narrative story, with the first person character evolving from little kid to senior, but the narrator keeps a rather stable voice, better fitting to a much older character: it makes the story less alive, much poorer.
	</p><p>
		Then the story itself is interesting only at some moments, and the whole plot, and outcome doesn't live up to any expectations, much less when the writer name is Stephen King.

	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Neal Stephenson</span>, 440 pages, published by Spectra the 2nd May 2000 (978-0-553-38095-8).
	</p><p>
		I would put this book among those that any geek should read at some moment. It is not complicated, not by the standards of Neal Stephenson, and quite easy to follow before he dwells on the babelian roots -all required, but heavy weight indeed-. He definitely had the imagination to think scenarios and ideas before his time.
	</p><p>
		Style is great, and humour is definitely not lacking, with the only drawbacks being the allegedly historic basis and spurious conversations with computer programs. A book can rarely been reviewed in isolation, and I can't but consider kinder-garden grade when I compare it with jewels like Revelation Space from Alastair Reynold. However, this later book was written a decade later, and feeds in many ways from the ideas raised by Snowcrash. 
	</p><p>
		And did I mention how fun is Snowcrash? [not the virus, just the book :-)]

	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Lev Grossman</span>, narrated by <span class="mark">Mark Bramhall</span>, unabridged version, 16h 27m, released by Penguin Audio the 5th August 2014.
	</p><p>
		I got borrowed this audiobook, without noticing that it is the last book of a trilogy. The story is anyway rather complete, and although I started wondering early enough if I was not missing parts of the story, it was only after half the book that I fully realized my mistake.
	</p><p>
		The story is alright, fantasy and magic in full gear, nicely complemented by the narrator, who did a great job adopting all the voices. But is also a bit lacking, almost never capturing my full attention. The passages of the book that I found more interesting had no fantasy within, they were mere descriptions of actions and situations, but they were really worthful.

	<p>
		By <span class="mark">iain M. banks</span>, 470 pages, published by Abacus, 2010 (978-0-349-11927-4).
	</p><p>
		Science fiction, and quite different from his Culture novels. Worlds within worlds, Banks at its best exploding his own imagination, describing multiple scenarios and actions in parallel. 
	</p><p>
		It is not a complicated book, and the story's concept is interesting. Fast pace at times, then excruciatingly slow at others where philosophy kicks in. Perhaps too much philosophy for the kind of book, and not the kind that makes me thinking, but overall a brilliant and solid book.

	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Peter Clines</span>, narrated by <span class="mark">Ray Porter</span>, unabridged version, 
		12h 38m, released by Audible Studios the 15th July 2014.
	</p><p>
		Great plot -rather original-, very likeable characters -but very artificial- and a good rhythm define this book, with a horror line wrapped in science fiction. 
	</p><p>
		The story is definitely intriguing, and the atmosphere crescendo is a continuos invitation to turn pages (or in my case, to keep listening the audio). It makes me think of Stephen King, but without (yet), his fabulous storytelling; And I will surely search now for other books from Peter Clines.

	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Nick Hornby</span>, 250 pages, published by the Penguin Group, 2009 (978-0-670-915651).
	</p><p>
		Loving disagreements abound, all the associated sadness gets diluted with enormous measures of humour. Some situations and characters are extreme, bizarre, which obviously helps the comic angles of the book; on the other side, feelings and thoughts are exposed in all honesty.
	</p><p>
		It is a book without nostalgia, but with a lot of looking back. But it doesn't invite to melancholy, or to meditation, just to laugh and to enjoy a good read.

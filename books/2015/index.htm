	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Peter Clines</span>, narrated by <span class="mark">Ray Porter</span>, unabridged version, 
		12h 38m, released by Audible Studios the 15th July 2014.
	</p><p>
		Great plot -rather original-, very likeable characters -but very artificial- and a good rhythm define this book, with a horror line wrapped in science fiction. 
	</p><p>
		The story is definitely intriguing, and the atmosphere crescendo is a continuos invitation to turn pages (or in my case, to keep listening the audio). It makes me think of Stephen King, but without (yet), his fabulous storytelling; And I will surely search now for other books from Peter Clines.

	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Nick Hornby</span>, 250 pages, published by the Penguin Group, 2009 (978-0-670-915651).
	</p><p>
		Loving disagreements abound, all the associated sadness gets diluted with enormous measures of humour. Some situations and characters are extreme, bizarre, which obviously helps the comic angles of the book; on the other side, feelings and thoughts are exposed in all honesty.
	</p><p>
		It is a book without nostalgia, but with a lot of looking back. But it doesn't invite to melancholy, or to meditation, just to laugh and to enjoy a good read.

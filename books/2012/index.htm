<p>By <span class="mark">Tabitha Suzuma</span>, 432 pages, published the 27th May 2010
by Definitions (978-1862308169)</p>

<p>To qualify this book as dark, or sad, or just black is missing several degrees of definition. If there is a path to make the reader feel bad, to wanting to close the book and escape some misery, the author definitely crossed all the dots.</p>
<p>Each chapter is just a progressive accumulation of anguish, unfortunately too well written as to dismiss it and let it on the section of never ended reads.</p>
<p>An interesting book, but also too uncomfortable.</p>

by Tor Books (978-0812578546)</p>

<p>If you read <a href='../2010/index.html#Jumper'>Jumper</a>, and you enjoyed it, surely you will enjoy Reflex. 
	Definitely lacking the freshness, the originality of the first part, but still a great read. In most aspects it is just the continuation of the first part, a bit more cheesy, but the plot is good and the pace, as expected, really fast.</p>
<p>And although the book is centered on a violation of the physics, it is a pleasure reading the 
	argumentations on what is happening and what it would imply -further violation of the physics, 
	naturally-.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">John Niven</span>, 336 pages, published the 5th February 2009
by Vintage (978-0099516675)</p>

<p>TIf I would use one single word to describe this book, it would be 'unexpected'. 
	The plot, the story, the style, the development, the final, all was rather surprising. 
	The superlative levels of immorality of its main character, the illusionary world after 
	massive ingestions of alcohol and drugs, the naked sex, the brutality at moments, 
	the overall depravation definitely help making this book difficult to digest.</p>

<p>The book starts like a generic funny novel, with the events on the life on a definitely 
	unusual guy, and for a while that seems to be the value of the book: humor, and some 
	crashing thoughts on life and the lives of people -well, normally women- that 
	provides for some hilarity. Depravation then escalates and suddenly there is a real 
	story behind, a plot whose end seems totally improbable.</p>

<p>It is brilliant and original, but not an easy read. I am not sure if I liked really the 
	end of the story for how it terminates of because it terminated.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">David Ellis</span>, 400 pages, published the 7th March 2006
by Berkley. (978-0425204290)</p>

<p>This book feels like a literary exercise, where a story is written backwards. 
	Not the basic essay where the beginning shows the end of the story, and then the
	story starts some time before and rolls from there on. 
	No, in this case the whole book goes backwards, and for 2/3 parts of the book, 
	the exercise seems hollow, and worse, boring. The pace is extenuating slow, and knowing how the story ends invites to drop the reading.</p>

<p>And that would be a grave error, as then the story develops itself very nicely; 
	now, in a normal crime -that is, forward-developed story-, the pace can go in crescendo, and 
	more clues / actions / characters can make for a complete different development of the story.
	In this plot, the new developments that happen occur in fact previously in time, so the already read story must account for it, letting much less space for surprises. And still, David Ellis really achieves it, reshaping the story continuously. </p>

<p>Totally recommended for the brilliance of the story and how is told, much less recommended for the 
	almost painful reading that a big part of the book brings.</p>

<h2><a name='ASongOfIceAndFire'>A Song of Ice and Fire (Books 1 to 4)</a> 
   <img src="../recommended9.gif" alt="9 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">George R.R. Martin</span>, published by Bantam; the first 4 books are:
	<ul>
		<li>Game Of Thrones, 831 pages, published the 4th August 1997 (978-0553573404)</li>
		<li>A Clash of Kings, 1040 pages, published the 5h September 2000 (978-0553579901)</li>
		<li>A Storm of Swords, 1216 pages, published the 4th March 2003 (978-0553573428)</li>
		<li>A Feast for Crows, 1104 pages, published the 26th September 2006 (978-0553582024)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
	
<p>Great fantasy story, developing a complex history in a medieval-like ambiance. 
	Violence is brutal, and sex becomes an integral part of the story.</p>

<p>The complexity of the history includes a vast amount of characters, helping at moments to a 
	rather convoluted read. The story is very detailed, the same when describing political manipulations, 
	or family genealogies, or even habits and customs of the different ethnic groups -which are, of 
	course, also abundant-; it really succeeds at building a complete world, much in the same way 
	as J.R.R. Tolkien did in the Lord of the Rings, although, in my opinion,
	Tolkien remains the definite master here.</p>

<p>I bought a pack with the 4 first books, summing up to 4191 pages, and expending like 3 months on them. 
	And I am definitely glad to know that there are more books already written in this series, and even more 
	to come. That good it is.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Don Wislow</span>, 560 pages, published the 27th April 2006
by Arrow. (978-0099464983)</p>

<p>I read this book as an interruption in my fantasy novels -between a Robin Hobbs 
	trilogy and the 4 books of Game of Thrones-, and quite an interruption it is, a 
	crash return to reality.</p>
	
<p>I ordered the book by a recommendation, without paying attention to the subject, and 
	I felt initially cheated when I discovered it was a book about narcotraffic. 
	I guess the instant disappointment lasted no more than 3 pages, after which I was
	already fully immersed in the story.</p>
	
<p>This is an outstanding book, exposing the reality of how useless can be the wrong 
	politics in place, and how cheap is life. And even if you do not care for the moral 
	of the story, the reading is extraordinary, a book difficult to turn down at any
	moment, a story perfectly developed and with characters very credible.</p>
	
<p>The style is very concise: short chapters helping the fast pace, and very literal,
	hiding nothing on the brutality of the reality -and brutal is at times, the same on the killings
	descriptions as on the sexual acts-.</p>
	
	
<p>Fully recommended.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Robin Hobb</span>, trilogy published by Spectra:
	<ul>
		<li>Ship of Magic, 832 pages, published the 2nd February 1999 (978-0553575637)</li>
		<li>The Mad Ship, 864 pages, published the 29th february 2000 (978-0553575644)</li>
		<li>Ship of Destiny, 800 pages, published the 27th November 2001 (978-0553575651)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
	
<p>After my error reading <a href='#TheDesertSpear'>The Desert Spear</a> so later after the 
	first part, I decided to buy this trilogy at once; I had already read other trilogy by 
	Robin Hobb -The Farseer Trilogy-, between July 2009 and August 2010, and had let me 
	with a good taste for this author.</p>
	
<p>My initial impression after receiving the books was rather negative -the covers look more 
	like a pink novel-, and reading the first 500 pages of the first book did nothing to 
	improve that impression. Let's say that, having bought only the first book, 
	I would have probably let it unfinished. As it comes, and owning already the next 
	two ones, I persisted on my efforts, and there was finally -and gladly- no disappointment.</p>
	
<p>Ship of Magic is, overall, a deception. It is slow, feels like a pink novel, 
	and there is very limited fantasy -all the fantasy is almost limited to the ship 
	being kind of alive. Characters seem extracted from 'how to pink a novel for dummies': 
	a lady losing its inheritance, a ship captain getting in love, the struggles of 
	the lady with rape and her feelings, and of course a pirate - a very bad one -.</p>
	
<p>The story peeks pace with the second book -The Mad Ship- and all the fantasy is
	fulfilled with Ship Of Destiny; and while the writing is pretty good, the pink tone 
	lingers all along. Finally, is a rater good story, but if I consider this trilogy 
	as an impressive book of almost 2500 pages, I can hardly recommend it.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Peter Brett</span>, 560 pages, published the 28th April 2011
by Harper Voyager. (978-0007276172)</p>

<p>This book is the second part of a yet incomplete trilogy, after 
	<a href='../2010/index.html#ThePaintedMan'>The Painted Man</a>,
	which I had read about 20 months ago. It is the kind of adventure books,
	with lot of action and very quick development that makes for an easy, 
	and enjoying read. It submerges the reader on a very fictional world, where
	magic and spells belong to the daily routine.</p>
	
<p>The book only seems slow on the first part of the book, which describes some 
	history that in fact predates the first trilogy book. Here I discovered my
	error, as I didn't remember that well that book, and had to reread passages
	of it to better follow the history. These are definitely books to read on
	a row, or with little pauses among them.</p>
	
<p>As summary, an amazing read, a rather fresh story, and better to tackle it
	when the whole trilogy is available.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Keigo Higashino</span>, 288 pages, published (translated) the 1st July 2004
by Vertical Inv. (978-1932234077)</p>

<p>Naoko includes, in line with most Japanese books I read, a dose of mystic, which 
	is always helpful to add originality to the story. It is a drama, but also a
	comedy, it is interesting and, above all, a great read. And let you wonder
	about life and love through its intriguing plot.</p>
	
<p>And if this was not enough to recommend this book, it really offers a glimpse of
	Japanese culture, of the Japanese way to understand the life day by day -interesting,
	if only for its differences with Western culture-. </p>

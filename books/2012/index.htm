<p>By <span class="mark">Don Wislow</span>, 560 pages, published the 27th April 2006
by Arrow. (978-0099464983)</p>

<p>I read this book as an interruption in my fantasy novels -between a Robin Hobbs 
	trilogy and the 4 books of Game of Thrones-, and quite an interruption it is, a 
	crash return to reality.</p>
	
<p>I ordered the book by a recommendation, without paying attention to the subject, and 
	I felt initially cheated when I discovered it was a book about narcotraffic. 
	I guess the instant disappointment lasted no more than 3 pages, after which I was
	already fully immersed in the story.</p>
	
<p>This is an outstanding book, exposing the reality of how useless can be the wrong 
	politics in place, and how cheap is life. And even if you do not care for the moral 
	of the story, the reading is extraordinary, a book difficult to turn down at any
	moment, a story perfectly developed and with characters very credible.</p>
	
<p>The style is very concise: short chapters helping the fast pace, and very literal,
	hiding nothing on the brutality of the reality -and brutal is at times, the same on the killings
	descriptions as on the sexual acts-.</p>
	
	
<p>Fully recommended.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Robin Hobb</span>, trilogy published by Spectra:
	<ul>
		<li>Ship of Magic, 832 pages, published the 2nd February 1999 (978-0553575637)</li>
		<li>The Mad Ship, 864 pages, published the 29th february 2000 (978-0553575644)</li>
		<li>Ship of Destiny, 800 pages, published the 27th November 2001 (978-0553575651)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
	
<p>After my error reading <a href='#TheDesertSpear'>The Desert Spear</a> so later after the 
	first part, I decided to buy this trilogy at once; I had already read other trilogy by 
	Robin Hobb -The Farseer Trilogy-, between July 2009 and August 2010, and had let me 
	with a good taste for this author.</p>
	
<p>My initial impression after receiving the books was rather negative -the covers look more 
	like a pink novel-, and reading the first 500 pages of the first book did nothing to 
	improve that impression. Let's say that, having bought only the first book, 
	I would have probably let it unfinished. As it comes, and owning already the next 
	two ones, I persisted on my efforts, and there was finally -and gladly- no disappointment.</p>
	
<p>Ship of Magic is, overall, a deception. It is slow, feels like a pink novel, 
	and there is very limited fantasy -all the fantasy is almost limited to the ship 
	being kind of alive. Characters seem extracted from 'how to pink a novel for dummies': 
	a lady losing its inheritance, a ship captain getting in love, the struggles of 
	the lady with rape and her feelings, and of course a pirate - a very bad one -.</p>
	
<p>The story peeks pace with the second book -The Mad Ship- and all the fantasy is
	fulfilled with Ship Of Destiny; and while the writing is pretty good, the pink tone 
	lingers all along. Finally, is a rater good story, but if I consider this trilogy 
	as an impressive book of almost 2500 pages, I can hardly recommend it.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Peter Brett</span>, 560 pages, published the 28th April 2011
by Harper Voyager. (978-0007276172)</p>

<p>This book is the second part of a yet incomplete trilogy, after 
	<a href='2010/index.html#ThePaintedMan'>The Painted Man</a>,
	which I had read about 20 months ago. It is the kind of adventure books,
	with lot of action and very quick development that makes for an easy, 
	and enjoying read. It submerges the reader on a very fictional world, where
	magic and spells belong to the daily routine.</p>
	
<p>The book only seems slow on the first part of the book, which describes some 
	history that in fact predates the first trilogy book. Here I discovered my
	error, as I didn't remember that well that book, and had to reread passages
	of it to better follow the history. These are definitely books to read on
	a row, or with little pauses among them.</p>
	
<p>As summary, an amazing read, a rather fresh story, and better to tackle it
	when the whole trilogy is available.</p>

<h2><a name='Naoko'>Naoko</a> 
   <img src="../recommended9.gif" alt="9 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Keigo Higashino</span>, 288 pages, published (translated) the 1st July 2004
by Vertical Inv. (978-1932234077)</p>

<p>Naoko includes, in line with most Japanese books I read, a dose of mystic, which 
	is always helpful to add originality to the story. It is a drama, but also a
	comedy, it is interesting and, above all, a great read. And let you wonder
	about life and love through its intriguing plot.</p>
	
<p>And if this was not enough to recommend this book, it really offers a glimpse of
	Japanese culture, of the Japanese way to understand the life day by day -interesting,
	if only for its differences with Western culture-. </p>

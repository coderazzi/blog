<p>By <span class="mark">Karin Slaughter</span>, 560 pages, published the 15th April 2010

<p>Great characters, interesting story, and an ingenious plot shape this well developed 
   thriller; and even the ending is unexpected.</p>

<p>It is not perfect; for once, I really disliked the gorey start; and the ending comes 
   too quickly and lets the story a bit orphan, with some naive explanation of the history 
   behind the crimes. Gives the impression of a careful studied plot completed on a rush. 
   But totally recommended.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Stieg Larsson</span>, 656 pages, published (reprint) the 1st April 2010
by Quercus Publishing Plc (978-1849162746)</p>

<p>I read the second part of the trilogy 20 months ago, and I was resisting the urge to buy this 
   last part; but after a couple of bad novels, I was lusting for a good reading time. Didn't 
   let me down, I started it at some slow pace, that got quickly into compulsive mode.</p>

<p>The plot is complete, filling even the few cracks in the previous books. In the whole series, 
   the only part that I find unsatisfactory is the computer hacking: not because is totally 
   impossible to happen, but for the total reliance of the stories on it: the events always 
   reach some impasse, conveniently solved through some convenient PC intrusion. 
   But this complain makes no dent on my impression of the series, indeed fantastic.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Peter Hoeg</span>, 416 pages, published the 4rd September 2008
by Vintage (978-0099507352)</p>


<p>The book starts more than promisingly. The first pages are a real pleasure to read, the prose is beautiful.</p>

<p>Soon, the reader -well, me-, starts to question his own intelligence, as the book seems erratic, 
so re-reading pages starts to be the norm. Then, the reader decides an aggressive approach and starts 
questioning the status of the writer, and soon thereafter, stops reading the book.</p>

<p>Slightly ashamed to admit it, I haven't read this book, after 90 minutes of fighting it 
I gave myself a definitive moratory, storing the book on that part of my shelves that 
conforms my particular Hall of Shame. </p>

<p>Obviously, I cannot recommend or criticize it. But take it easy if you go for it.</p>

<h2><a name='TooBigToFail'>Too Big To Fail</a> <img src="../recommended7.gif" alt="7 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Andrew Ross Sorkin</span>, 640 pages, published the 1st July 2010
by Penguin (978-0141043166)</p>

<p>A total fiction on the big crisis surrounding Lehman Brothers, that is not fiction at all. 
The work done by Andress Ross Sorkin to provide a full scenario for the events described in the 
book is just superb, as to wonder if most of them were just a fictional recreation 
(the notes and sources at the end of the book convinced me that this was not the case).</p>

<p>The book is fascinating, and leads too often to be read as just a novel; for that reason, 
is easy to read it compulsively, missing then the introspection to understand what really 
happened in that crisis. The book described the institutions participating on the chaos, but 
it focused on the people, on the individual characters that shaped it. It does not study the 
economics that originated the crisis -although the steps are perfectly described-, and exposes 
no lessons learnt from the debacle, perhaps because the institutions themselves seem oblivious 
to any such lessons.</p>

<p>As such, is therefore a very interesting relate of the crisis events, and I would 
recommend it to anybody trying to understand why -humanly- this crisis ever happened.</p>

<h2><a name='Manazuru'>Manazuru</a> <img src="../recommended2.gif" alt="2 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Hiromi Kawakami</span>, 224 pages, published (reprint) the 31st August 2010
by Counterpoint LLC (978-1582436005)</p>

<p>After 15 months retired from Japanese literature, my return was very disappointing. 
Manazuru is slow, unimaginative, and lacking any of the mystic and magic that I usually 
associate to contemporary Japanese books; not that it doesn't try, it includes its ghost 
that leads the protagonist and intuition seems to be the only driver, but somehow the 
magic is totally missing.</p>

<p>Then, its slowness; not that nothing happens, is more like nothing can happen, 
like any resemblance to have a plot is again the boot itself. So the book is nicely written, 
is easy to read, to enjoy its words, but has no lesson, no end; it is like reading a book 
for the pleasure to see its words coming together. Just not enough.</p>

		By <span class="mark">Haruki Murakami</span>, published by Vintage the 2nd August 2012 (978-0099578079). [This is the edition including the books 1, 2 &amp; 3]
	</p><p>
		Perhaps not the Murakami's novel that I have enjoyed best, but it still holds many of the ingredients that make Murakami so utterly enjoyable, including a very unique story line and a fantasy World difficult to grasp. 
	</p><p>
		The plot is a bit too long, if finishes without a proper climax, and the whole book lacks much of the mysticism that makes Murakami one of my favourite writers, but it is still a great novel and a extraordinarily well told story..

		By <span class="mark">Karin Slaughter</span>, published by Arrow the 23rd June 2011 (978-0099553106).
	</p><p>
		Buying a Slaughter's novel means getting a crime novel and its usual perks. Characters are rather swallow, and that helps the author describing the book from different actors, portraying a completely separated view of the plot, which gives some additional depth to the story.
	</p><p>
		All together, is a good novel, but as many crime ones, not really memorable.

		By <span class="mark">Stephen King</span>, published by Galley Books the 24th July 2012 (978-1451627299).
	</p><p>
		I have never had any interest on the story behind the assassination of JFK, but this book surely awoke it. 
	</p><p>
		Stephen King has a great touch to tell stories, and I got totally submerged in this one. The ambiance is immersive, descriptions always deep, characters very alive, and tangled all together, the plots; the story of the assassination and the actors involved -without historic rigour-,  the real life of a person trying to derail the murder, the possibilities of time traveling. And 3 of the characters of a favourite Stephen's King book of mine, IT, are featured in this book -call it a bonus or easter egg-.
	</p><p>
		11.22.63 describes the real events -with theatrical enhancements, definitely-; but there is definitely not a lack of suspense in the story, as reality get bended under the pen of Stephen King. It is great story, and just remember: the past is obdurate.

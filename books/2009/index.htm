<h2The Girld With The Dragon Tattoo<img src="../recommended10.gif" alt="10 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Stieg Larsson</span>, 572 pages, published the 10th Jan 2008 
(English translation) by MacLehose Press (978-1847242532)</p>

<p>When I first heard about this book, it was classified as a crime book. 
Although it certainly envolves a crime  -or a lot of them, I find difficult 
to think of it as crime book-.</p>

<p>The English title is on itself an interesting translation, as it was 
originally named 'Men who hate women' -each book's part is prefaced with 
some statistics on male abuse in Sweden. The original name is definitely 
closer to the subject, although it is definitely less marketable.</p>

<p>There is some mistery inside - the case of a girl long time ago dissapeared-, 
but that is neither the  real focus of the novel, and it is even solved much before 
the novel ends. The author keeps hight the reader's attention by following at the
same time several stories, and the missing girl's story is just one of them. 
The girl with the dragon tatoo has her own story, as it does the main book's 
character, a journalist, or the interesting Vanger family:  the characters 
are very engaging, and Stieg Larson does a great job as the storyteller.</p>

<p>It is not just that the story is well told, it is very cleverly done. 
Sure, it is interesting that the whole plot is finally solved via computer 
hacking, and that the hacker is the best hacker in the world, and that the hacker, 
despite being quite socially limited, is able to play the role of a femme fatale
in Zurich, deviating funds worth millions, but the need for this 007 lady is, 
probably, the only weak point
on this (crime | thriller | clever!) novel.</p>

<p>Recommended: definitely, just pay attention to your sleeping time. 
I spent a zombie day after an 
interesting night....</p>

<h2>The Fields Of Grief <img src="../recommended8.gif" alt="8 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Giles Blunt</span>, 400 pages, published the 4th Dec 2006 
by HarperCollins Publishers Ltd (978-0007151394)</p>

<p>Easy, fast reading, sad story very well written.</p>

<p>I was unable to drop the book once started. Curiously, one of the cases in this thriller is 
pedophilia, exactly the same as in my previous book, The Treatment. While in that book the 
whole story seems unplausible, in this book it blendes perfectly.</p>

<p>As a mistery novel, the mistery is on itself quickly unveiled. But the writing is excellent, and
I could f-e-e-l the enormous grief of Cardinal through the death of his wife. Definitely recommended.

<h2>The Treatment <img src="../recommended4.gif" alt="4 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Mo Hayder</span>, 499 pages, published the 1st Feb 2005 by Bantam Books (978-0553816990)</p>

<p>This is not really a bad book, even if I can't recommend it and knowing that I won't reread it. 
It is just too dense, too difficult to enjoy. 
I was almost dropping it page after page, and only by the 380th page I knew would complete it. 
But the impression that lingers after the book is finished is in fact quite alright.
</p>
<p>I read a few years ago another book by Mo Hayden, Tokyo, and it was definitely a good thriller.
 Later, I tried Pig Island, which remains in the corner of my unfinished books. 
 All these 3 books share something in common: 
 the main characters are too fictional, too unrealistic, it is difficult to have any emphaty with them.

<h2>The Book Thief <img src="../recommended9.gif" alt="9 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Markus Zusak</span>, 560 pages, published the 1st Jan 2008 by Black Swan (978-0552773898)</p>

<p>Great book; after a slow, dissapointing starting, it keeps a leisure pace that is a joy to read. 
   It is definitely one of the best books I have read lately. 
   Once ended, I long for the life of Rudy Steiner or Liesel Meminger, or the Saukerl of the Mum, 
   all taken by the book's narrator.
</p>

<p>The story is developed in Germany, close to Munich, during the Second World War. The narrator is the
Death, a half caustic, half poetic Death, with a serious work overload due to the circumstances. 
But it also the narration of Liesel Meminger, a foster child living with a poor family. 
</p>

<p>Most chapters could be nice short stories. I am not sure if my favourite would be the chapter
describing the presents to Max, the hidden Jew, or the utterly sad chapter describing the bombing to
Molching. But better enjoy the whole length at once, 560 pages to taste.

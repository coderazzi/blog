<h2>The Fields Of Grief <img src="../recommended8.gif" alt="8 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Giles Blunt</span>, 400 pages, published the 4th Dec 2006 
by HarperCollins Publishers Ltd (978-0007151394)</p>

<p>Easy, fast reading, sad story very well written.</p>

<p>I was unable to drop the book once started. Curiously, one of the cases in this thriller is 
pedophilia, exactly the same as in my previous book, The Treatment. While in that book the 
whole story seems unplausible, in this book it blendes perfectly.</p>

<p>As a mistery novel, the mistery is on itself quickly unveiled. But the writtng is excellent, and
I could f-e-e-l the enormous grief of Cardinal through the death of his wife. Definitely recommended.

<h2>The Treatment <img src="../recommended4.gif" alt="4 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Mo Hayder</span>, 499 pages, published the 1st Feb 2005 by Bantam Books (978-0553816990)</p>

<p>This is not really a bad book, even if I can't recommend it and knowing that I won't reread it. 
It is just too dense, too difficult to enjoy. 
I was almost dropping it page after page, and only by the 380th page I knew would complete it. 
But the impression that lingers after the book is finished is in fact quite alright.
</p>
<p>I read a few years ago another book by Mo Hayden, Tokyo, and it was definitely a good thriller.
 Later, I tried Pig Island, which remains in the corner of my unfinished books. 
 All these 3 books share something in common: 
 the main characters are too fictional, too unrealistic, it is difficult to have any emphaty with them.

<h2>The Book Thief <img src="../recommended9.gif" alt="9 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Markus Zusak</span>, 560 pages, published the 1st Jan 2008 by Black Swan (978-0552773898)</p>

<p>Great book; after a slow, dissapointing starting, it keeps a leisure pace that is a joy to read. 
   It is definitely one of the best books I have read lately. 
   Once ended, I last for the life of Rudy Steiner or Liesel Meminger, or the Saukerl of the Mum, 
   all taken by the book's narrator.
</p>

<p>The story is developed in Germany, close to Munich, during the Second World War. The narrator is the
Death, a half caustic, half poetic Death, with a serious work overload due to the cirscunstances. 
But it also the narration of Liesel Meminger, a foster child living with a poor family. 
</p>

<p>Most chapters could be nice short stories. I am not sure if my favourite would be the chapter
describing the presents to Max, the hidden Jew, or the utterly sad chapter describing the bombing to
Molching. But better enjoy the whole length at once, 560 pages to taste.

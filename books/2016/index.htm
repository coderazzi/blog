            By <span class="mark">Nick Hornby</span>, 272 pages, published by Penguin;
            (6 Feb 2014) (978-0241968895).

        <p>
            The back cover includes a Sunday Times quote &quot;Extremely funny ... and wise&quot;;
            I would rather say &quot;Quite wise ... and somehow funny&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is an interesting book, quite a drama toned down with good humor.
            And Nick Hornby doesn't fall in the trap of trying to patronize the reader with easy conclusions, or
            dramatic outcomes on the subject of suicidal actions.
            All the contrary, it just drops wise perceptions on life, on human nature.
            It does so with the help of four protagonists, all very real, all very different from each other, and
            all providing hilarious situations enough as to counter what could have been a somber read.

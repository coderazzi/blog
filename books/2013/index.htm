<h2><a name='endOfTheWorld'>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</a> 
   <img src="../recommended9.gif" alt="9 out of 10"></h2>

	<p>
		By <span class="mark">Haruki Murakami</span>, narrated by Adam Sims, Ian Porter. 11 CDs, published the 6th April 2010 by Naxus AudioBooks (978-9626343388)
	</p><p>
		Murakami in full fantasy swing, the story is kind of a perfect hallucination, playing, in fact, with the self world of the main character. Perfect on its style, the narration plays as if there is nothing extraordinary going on, while the reader enters a world totally up down, or, in this case, totally in out. 
	</p><p>
		The book is obviously science fiction, including the usual Murakami tidbits of suspense, his usual love for music and food, romanticism and sex, and more interestingly, a lot of philosophy. It is a book about existentialism, about self discovery, and, very suitably, the end of the book is completely open: is were the two worlds depicted along the novel can finally merge, but that merging, that discovery of the self is just let unfinished. 
	</p><p>
		More than recommendable reading, or listening, in this case. And the narrators on this audiobook give a real great performance.

		By <span class="mark">Stuart Neville </span>, 512 pages, published the 18th August 2011 by Vintage (978-0099535355)
	</p><p>
		Although a rather typical thriller, the very fast pace and a interesting plot place this book apart. There is even some 6th sense to help adding interest to the story.
	</p><p>
		It is a book I enjoyed reading a lot, finishing it in 3 days; nothing perennial on it, but just a damn good read. Just a note: the book is a second part of <span class="mark">Twelve</span>, and although self-contained, is always a shame missing the preceding parts.

		By <span class="mark">Ian Rankin</span>, 448 pages, published the 7th August 2008 (reprint) by Orion (978-0752883618)
	</p><p>
		Back to old good Inspector Rebus, guarantee of black narration, this time on a run of sobriety. My casual selection of Rebus titles implies a non sequential, historic read, so I jump from an almost retiring Rebus to a pretty young one, with the corresponding dancing of side characters and expected behaviours -although in this last aspect, it seems all along a rather consistent character.
	</p><p>
		In this novel there is a huge mix of international criminals, including Serbians, Japanese (Yakuza) and even alleged old nazis; the interconnections are cleverly managed, although the whole core of the novel is really naive. All together: a good time reading; the final taste is on the atmosphere, not on the solved case or cases.

		By <span class="mark">George R.R. Martin</span>, 1056 pages, published the 29th October 2012 by Bantam (978-0553385953)
	</p><p>
		This is the fifth book of Song of Ice and Fire; <a href='../2012/index.htm#ASongOfIceAndFire'>after reading</a> the first 4 books, it was just a matter of time to fall for the 5th delivery. 
	</p><p>
		This is really a flat continuation of the same story, so little more can be said on it: George R.R. Martin keeps the same powerful play, with many many locations, and many many more characters, and the kind of convoluted and intricate story that makes this read as interesting as the previous books.

		By <span class="mark">Haruki Murakami</span>, narrated by Rupert Degas. 11 CDs, published the 29th October 2007 by Naxus AudioBooks (978-9626344354)
	</p><p>
		I had read this book already, around 10 years ago. This time, I got the audio CD as my company for a long trip by car. It was my first time experiencing with audio CDs and this was like an spot choice -I have started afterwards a few others, and none has impressed me so much as this first choice-.
	</p><p>
		The book is great, perfect Murakami style: fantastic story telling, vivid imagination, surreal scenarios, suspense, and its load of philosophical concerns. And all centred on an interesting character, kind of some antihero. It is a really enjoyable reading.
	</p><p>
		Or, in this case, a really enjoyable listening. The narrator makes an incredible job on this book; a single person provides all the voices, and is utterly credible at making the listening experience really smooth. Fantastic book, superb narrator.

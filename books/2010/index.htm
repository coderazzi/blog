<h2>Set In darkness <img src="../recommended9.gif" alt="9 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Ian Rankin</span>, 496 pages, published the 7th August 2008
by Orion (978-0752883632)</p>

<p>Quite the typical John Rebus novel, at times darker than usual -as the title reflects-.</p>

<p>It is probably one of the best in the Rebus series, 
   at least related to the ambiance it creates. 
   The plot is rather lineal, more interesting by tangling several cases together 
   and adding some history on the cocktail.</p>

<p>Perhaps its weakest point if the end, which if nicely unexpected, 
   is also slightly disappointing.</p>

<h2>Royal Assassin <img src="../recommended9.gif" alt="9 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Robin Hobb</span>, 768 pages, published the 3rd September 2007 (reissue)
by Harper Voyager (978-0006480105)</p>

<p>I read the first part last year, and what I wrote 
<a href='../2009/index.htm#assassins_appretince'>then</a> applies quite well for 
this fantastic second part. It is even better, more solid, although also with
much more fiction. Ravenous, thinking already on the 3rd part.</p>

<h2>Slaughterhouse 5 <img src="../recommended10.gif" alt="10 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Kurt Vonnegut</span>, 176 pages, published in 1991
by Vintage (978-0099800200)</p>

<p>An auto-referent book, where the motifs behind it are part of the book itself, and the book seems totally alien to the story is trying to tell. That's it, I am more drawn to the style of the book than to the story that it tells, or that it intends to tell.</p>

<p>You see, the main point of the book is the story behind, the bombing of Dresden, and the unnecessary death of far more people than Hiroshima or Nagasaki killed. But what I remember from the book is the style, the prose of Vonnegut, his way to tell things. I guess I am just another Tralfamadorian, able to watch the Earthling Zoo, thinking that there is nothing to solve. I pay full tribute to the cleverness of this book, although it still failed to move me.</p>

<h2>Saturn's Children <img src="../recommended8.gif" alt="8 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Charles Stross</span>, 400 pages, published the 2nd July 2009
by Orbit (978-1841495682)</p>

<p>Huge. I hadn't read science fiction for quite a long time, and I was frankly rusty for the exhibition of imagination in this book, just amazing.</p>
<p>I am not sure what I really prefer: if the realism of the actions -interplanetary trips that take indeed months or years, the boredom during those trips-, the often used scientific explanations, the ironies and humor -these are robots, bored robots, even with existential problems-, or the erotism -yes, even with robots-.</p>
<p>Then, it comes the plot, as imaginative as the descriptions of unknown worlds, and really twisted. Of course, it is a plot where basic logical rules do not apply, so it is quite a challenge to follow.</p>
<p>A definitely recommended book, if only to be part, for a while, of a completely different world.</p>

<h2>Starting Over <img src="../recommended6.gif" alt="6 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Tony Parsons</span>, 320 pages, published the 6th August 2009
by Harper (978-0007226511)</p>

<p>Not bad, but not really good.</p>
<p>A story that it is supposed to be touching, but I am afraid it is not. And then, there is not much more: no humor, no action, no drama. </p>
<p>But it is still good as the story of some (strange) daily life.</p>
<p>Recommended: not really; I think the book is above average because the writer is good at telling a mediocre story.</p>

<h2>The Painted Man <img src="../recommended10.gif" alt="10 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Peter V. Brett</span>, 560 pages, published the 2nd April 2009
by CollingsVoyager (reprint) (978-0007276141)</p>

<p>Not a great start, a bit heavy. Then, quickly, it becomes painful to drop the book. By the time it is finished and you realize that there is a continuation, the sequel book is just a necessity. Alas, in this moment is not available (only in hardcover, which I try to avoid on principle).</p>

<p>It is a fantasy book, a world populated by the darkness, and the story of who revels against it. The story is carefully described, all steps well connected, and the best: the story does not end with the book, it is just the first of a trilogy: <span class="mark">The Demon Trilogy</span>.</p>
<p> The story is huge. There are so many aspects that the author could just pursuit, I wonder if he does on the other books on the trilogy. Definitely not on the same level of Tolkien, but the comparison is already good, just because it can be done.</p>

<h2>Jumper <img src="../recommended10.gif" alt="10 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Steven Gould</span>, 352 pages, published the 1st January 1992
by Tor Books (978-0812522372)</p>

<p>Jumper is a great nerdy story; cover to cover in a couple of days, fun ensured.</p>
<p>Now, it is true that the story is too simple -but, as Orson Scott Ward says-, what a great way to write such simpleness. </p>
<p>It differs from the movie's story -there is a separate adaptation, called &quot;Jumper: Griffin's story&quot;-; I saw the movie, nice, but only in the way that it plays with the teleporting idea. The movie introduces some enemies to the Jumpers, and the religious idea behind those enemies is too stretched. </p>

<p>I doubt I will ever read the movie's book, my recommendation goes definitely for this story, and I am already thinking on its continuation (Reflex - 978-0812578546).</p>

<h2>Red To Black <img src="../recommended7.gif" alt="7 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Alex Dryden</span>, 512 pages, published the 5th March 2009
by Headline Review (978-0755345014)</p>

<p>Very atypical spy fiction, short on action, but large in ambiance, mixing carefully facts and fiction to draw a more than credible story.</p>

<p>The story itself is by moments on the very fictional side, but the conclusions, even if (very) alarmist, are worth considering: they draw a picture of the actual Russia that, even being biased, is quite frightening.</p>

<p>Great reading, once the first chapters are over. The nice ambiance is only achieved later, by the middle of the book; up to that moment, I seriously considered dropping the book for good. Relieved I didn't!</p>

<h2>Blood Runs Cold <img src="../recommended6.gif" alt="6 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Alex Barclay</span>, 496 pages, published the 1st December 2008
by Harper (978-0007268443)</p>

<p>The book is well written, but the thriller lacks consistency, is quite disjointed. And the style is quite dense; I started reading the book and then I dropped it for 4 months -but the same happened with all the books in this period, perhaps it was just my reading mood, or perhaps I just did too many bad choices.</p>

<p>There are lot of clues in the book without meaning on its own: kind of a book on a series, where the previous books are missing. But, as it happens, this is the first book of the author with these characters, so she is probably just laying the basis for others books to come.</p>

<p>Whatever is the reason, there is a feeling, after reading the book, that much information is missing. Specially the very last chapters, they are pretty successful at confusing any reader (in a poor, no clever manner, I should add).</p>

<p>Perhaps this review looks discouraging, but, in fact, I kind of enjoyed the reading.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Iris Johansen</span>, 284 pages, published the 20th October 2009
by St. Martin's Press (978-0312368104)</p>

<p>Boring. But, to its credit, I was able to finish it -barely-.</p>

<p>It mixes a lot of action with banal lengthy conversations, 
trying to push a feminist message in the wrong context.</p>

<p>Burn in peace.</p>

<h2>Bad Science <img src="../recommended8.gif" alt="8 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Ben Goldacre</span>, 288 pages, published the 2nd April 2009
by HarperPerennial (978-0007284870)</p>

<p>I have been reading this book slowly, a chapter from time to time, for about 5 months.
It is interesting, well written, and with just too many good points, although not a 
reading pleasure.</p>

<p>Bad Science attacks mainly two points: the alternative Medicine -like homeopathy-, 
and the media coverage of Medicine and Science in general. 
And the author seems on a mission to make everybody realize their dangers; 
to such a point that I was surprised to find a picture of the
author on the back cover and discover that he was quite young (thirtyish when he wrote it),
 quite different from the impression I had: 
an old chap, burned out after many years of fighting stunts with the media or the alternative medicine. </p>

<p>While I think that the book could condensate its content in less pages, its ideas are very much worth spreading.</p>

<p>During these months, I bought a second book, Irrationality, which shares some content with Bad Science, but has, in my opinion, a wider scope, a better argumentation, 
and some more humor within.</p>

<h2>Show No Fear <img src="../recommended5.gif" alt="5 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Perry O'Shaughnessy</span>, 464 pages, published the 20th October 2009
by Pocket Star (978-1416548676)</p>

<p>This is one of those books belonging to a series, centered about a recurrent character, in this
case a lawyer student / assistant called Nina Reilly. I am not sure if the idea is to create a 
bond on the reader to that character, to better sell other books, or it is simply that the author is able
to reuse it then more easily, not having to create new characters in future books.</p>

<p>I guess this works sometimes: Inspector Rebus, Lisbeth Salander, or, definitely, Calvin and Hobbes.</p>

<p>Because this Nina Reilly is perhaps the only element in the book with some depth, 
as the rest of the characters in the book, are all quite extreme, like extracted
from a psychology book outlining how the good people behave and how are the bad ones; this makes the
story a tad weaker and the book less pleasant to read. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the story is rather good; the suspense is not lifted in the latest moment, as the first scene 
has already the clues of the whole development. Perhaps the end is precipitated, rushing to a conclusion,
in opposition to the slow pace of the rest of the book. In short, the book is slightly better than passable.</p>

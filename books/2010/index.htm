<p>By <span class="mark">Perry O'Shaughnessy</span>, 464 pages, published the 20th October 2009
by Pocket Star (978-1416548676)</p>

<p>This is one of those books belonging to a series, centered about a given character, in this
case a lawyer student / assistant called Nina Reilly. I am not sure if the idea is to create a 
bond on the reader to that character, to better sell other books, or it is simply that the author is able
to reuse it then more easily, not having to create new characters in future books.</p>

<p>Because this Nina Reilly is perhaps the only element in the book with some personality, 
as the rest of the characters in the book, are all quite extreme, like extracted
from a psychology book outlining how the good people behave and how are the bad ones; this makes the
story a tad weaker and the book less pleasant to read. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the story is rather good; the suspense is not lifted in the latest moment, as the first scene 
has already the clues of the whole development. Perhaps the end is precipitated, rushing to a conclusion,
in opposition to the slow pace of the rest of the book. In short, the book is slightly better than passable.</p>

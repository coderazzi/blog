<h2>Deadlock <img src="../recommended4.gif" alt="4 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Iris Johansen</span>, 284 pages, published the 20th October 2009
by St. Martin's Press (978-0312368104)</p>

<p>Boring. But, to its credit, I was able to finish it -barely-.</p>

<p>It mixes a lot of action with banal lengthy conversations, 
trying to push a feminist message in the wrong context.</p>

<p>Burn in peace.</p>

<h2>Bad Science <img src="../recommended8.gif" alt="8 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Ben Goldacre</span>, 288 pages, published the 2nd April 2009
by HarperPerennial (978-0007284870)</p>

<p>I have been reading this book slowly, a chapter from time to time, for about 5 months.
It is interesting, well written, and with just too many good points, although not a 
reading pleasure.</p>

<p>Bad Science attacks mainly two points: the alternative Medicine -like homeopathy-, 
and the media coverage of Medicine and Science in general. 
And the author seems on a mission to make everybody realize their dangers; 
to such a point that I was surprised to find a picture of the
author on the back cover and discover that he was quite young (thirtyish when he wrote it),
 quite different from the impression I had: 
an old chap, burned out after many years of fighting stunts with the media or the alternative medicine. </p>

<p>While I think that the book could condensate its content in less pages, its ideas are very much worth spreading.</p>

<p>During these months, I bought a second book, Irrationality, which shares some content with Bad Science, but has, in my opinion, a wider scope, a better argumentation, 
and some more humor within.</p>

<h2>Show No Fear <img src="../recommended5.gif" alt="5 out of 10"></h2>

<p>By <span class="mark">Perry O'Shaughnessy</span>, 464 pages, published the 20th October 2009
by Pocket Star (978-1416548676)</p>

<p>This is one of those books belonging to a series, centered about a recurrent character, in this
case a lawyer student / assistant called Nina Reilly. I am not sure if the idea is to create a 
bond on the reader to that character, to better sell other books, or it is simply that the author is able
to reuse it then more easily, not having to create new characters in future books.</p>

<p>I guess this works sometimes: Inspector Rebus, Lisbeth Salander, or, definitely, Calvin and Hobbes.</p>

<p>Because this Nina Reilly is perhaps the only element in the book with some depth, 
as the rest of the characters in the book, are all quite extreme, like extracted
from a psychology book outlining how the good people behave and how are the bad ones; this makes the
story a tad weaker and the book less pleasant to read. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the story is rather good; the suspense is not lifted in the latest moment, as the first scene 
has already the clues of the whole development. Perhaps the end is precipitated, rushing to a conclusion,
in opposition to the slow pace of the rest of the book. In short, the book is slightly better than passable.</p>
